            "Como recordatorio durante la sesión en directo, todos los participantes pueden formular preguntas en directo en cualquier momento, simplemente pulsando el botón correspondiente en la parte superior de la página.\n",
            "Esto es un extracto de la política que se publica en nuestro sitio web en su totalidad.\n",
            "Las preguntas serán recibidas por el profesor Riccardo Audisio del Western Hospital, Universidad de Liverpool, Prescott, Reino Unido, quien las comentará con el profesor Charles M. Balch del MD Anderson Cancer Center de la Universidad de Texas, Houston, Texas, EE. UU.\n",
            "Ahora le concedemos la palabra al Profesor Balch.\n",
            "Profesor, su micrófono está abierto.\n",
            "Hola a todos.\n",
            "Soy Charles Balch de Houston, Texas, y me complace unirme a este seminario web para hablar sobre el impacto de los resultados quirúrgicos oncológicos y también participo en esto con mi buen amigo el profesor Riccardo Audisio, ex presidente de la Sociedad Británica de Oncología Quirúrgica y el presidente electo de la Sociedad Europea de Oncología Quirúrgica y él moderará una ronda de preguntas y respuestas al final de mi presentación.\n",
            "Así que voy a exponer brevemente mis diapositivas, pero espero que más adelante descarguen varios artículos que creo que son documentos fundamentales que involucran cirujanos de todo el mundo, y que provienen de la Comisión Lancet que se publicaron en 2015 en Lancet Oncology.\n",
            "El primero de ellos fue sobre cirugía global en el año 2030 y voy a leer unas citas de estos artículos.\n",
            "La primera es que el acceso a la atención quirúrgica es esencial para reducir la mortalidad y morbilidad por afecciones quirúrgicas, sin embargo y esto es realmente un hecho importante y alarmante.Más de 2000 millones de personas no tienen acceso a la cirugía y la anestesia y, además, esta cifra está probablemente subestimada.\n",
            "Por lo tanto, el acceso universal a una atención quirúrgica segura y asequible es fundamental.\n",
            "En un artículo posterior en el que participamos el Dr. Audisio y yo, en Lancet Oncology, nos centramos en la cirugía oncológica global y en cómo administrar una cirugía oncológica segura, asequible y oportuna y realmente yo recomendaría que todos los que nos están escuchando lo leyeran.\n",
            "Bueno, este artículo fue publicado en Lancet Oncology en 2015 y como pueden ver en las flechas el Dr. Audisio y yo fuimos sus coautores y parte del resumen que voy a destacar muy brevemente indicaba que para el año 2030, para lo que solo faltan trece años, calculamos que serán necesarios 45 millones de procedimientos quirúrgicos en todo el mundo y sin embargo menos del 25% de los pacientes de cáncer en todo el mundo realmente consiguen una cirugía segura, asequible u oportuna.\n",
            "Así que queda mucho trabajo por hacer a este respecto y citaré algunas cosas más de este artículo en Lancet Oncology; que los problemas del acceso a la cirugía, la escasez de inversión en sistemas quirúrgicos públicos, la baja inversión en investigación, en formación, en cirugía y las brechas en formación están notablemente extendidas en todo el mundo.\n",
            "Y hemos ofrecido soluciones que incluyen, un sistema público mejor regulado, especialmente en la formación y la certificación de cirujanos, colaboraciones internacionales, súper centralización de los servicios quirúrgicos y, volveré a hablar de esto más tarde, nuevos ensayos clínicos quirúrgicos, y nuevos enfoques para mejorar la calidad y el escalamiento de los sistemas de cirugía oncológica cáncer a través de la formación y la capacitación.\n",
            "Les daré algunos ejemplos más adelante en esta conferencia.\n",
            "Continuando con algunas declaraciones más resumidas de este importante artículo, lograr buenos resultados en la cirugía oncológica moderna es algo técnicamente exigente y es sabido que los resultados mejoran cuando dicha cirugía es realizada por equipos especializados en centros de alto volumen.\n",
            "Y voy a entrar en esta importante estrategia con más detalle, pero haciendo hincapié en que estamos hablando de los pacientes más complicados, las operaciones más complicadas, y en centros de alto volumen.\n",
            "Pero creo que lo que es importante como resumen es que el acceso a la formación de alta calidad en estas unidades, con la acreditación y el control de calidad adecuados para los aspirantes a cirujanos oncológicos, todavía tiene que ser cumplido formalmente por parte de las autoridades regulatorias en un número considerable de países.\n",
            "Y aunque los países con niveles de renta altos como muchos países de Europa y Estados Unidos están impulsando una mayor especialización, a nivel mundial se necesitan cirujanos con una formación mucho más amplia; las asociaciones profesionales quirúrgicas deben desempeñar un papel más importante en esta área y, por último, que los países con niveles de renta altos y medios tienen el deber y la oportunidad de ampliar sus ofertas formativas de cirugía oncológica a países con niveles de renta bajos a través de intercambios bilaterales, de un mayor uso de la formación reforzada por la tecnología y colaboraciones para desarrollar contenidos curriculares específicos sobre el cáncer dentro de programas de formación de residentes de cirugía general.\n",
            "Estos son solo algunos ejemplos de las asociaciones y la disponibilidad de programas globales de formación, como la Sociedad de Oncología Quirúrgica, la Sociedad Europea, la Asociación Británica y otras muchas organizaciones como la ESMO, la ASCO, y un grupo en el que participo llamado Health Volunteers Overseas, con sede en los Estados Unidos.\n",
            "En las siguientes diapositivas quiero destacar la importancia y el valor de la especialización en términos de calidad de la atención.\n",
            "Ha habido avances rápidos y sustanciales en la investigación del cáncer, con nuevos diagnósticos mediante biomarcadores, nuevas terapias sistémicas que incluyen quimioterapia, terapia hormonal, terapia dirigida y, más recientemente, inmunoterapia.\n",
            "Y esto ha dado lugar a nuevas combinaciones y secuencias de tratamientos contra el cáncer, incluidos tratamientos neoadyuvantes y adyuvantes en los pacientes quirúrgicos.\n",
            "Así que todos los que nos dedicamos a la cirugía tenemos que estar al día en los rápidos avances de estos campos.\n",
            "También se están produciendo grandes avances en las tecnologías quirúrgicas en el quirófano, como la cirugía laparoscópica, la cirugía robótica y las técnicas de imagen intraoperatorias.Y entonces, la pregunta es, cómo podemos extirpar el cáncer con mejores resultados y más seguros, con menor incidencia de complicaciones y mejor control local regional, y la importancia, además de la rehabilitación y el restablecimiento de la función de los pacientes después de la cirugía.\n",
            "Y ahora hay muchos cambios en la forma de administrar atención oncológica a través del concepto regional de centros oncológicos, un equipo multidisciplinario de especialistas oncológicos que tiene que incluir cirujanos que deciden pasar parte de su tiempo como miembros de un equipo multidisciplinario y participar en la planificación del tratamiento con nuestros colegas en radiooncología médica, patología y radiología.\n",
            "Y les mostraré algunas diapositivas que demuestran que los centros oncológicos de alto volumen y los especialistas quirúrgicos obtienen mejores resultados al tratar cánceres complejos.\n",
            "Y como ya he dicho, en el fondo esto no significa que para las operaciones de rutina y los pacientes de rutina sea necesario especializarse porque necesitamos cirujanos generales que practiquen cirugía de alta calidad y segura, pero que tengan el criterio necesario para saber cuándo algunos pacientes deben ser transferidos a un centro regional donde podrían obtener mejores resultados.\n",
            "Y sólo para mostrarles un ejemplo de una enfermedad frecuente, me referiré a una publicación en el British Journal of Cancer en 2004, en la que comento que las pacientes con cáncer de mama tratadas por especialistas en comparación con una unidad no especializada tenían la mitad de riesgo de recibir un tratamiento inadecuado de la mama y un riesgo cinco veces menor de someterse a una cirugía axilar inadecuada y un riesgo nueve veces menor de recibir un tratamiento axilar inadecuado; y que las tasas de recurrencia locales, que es una medida del resultado quirúrgico, era un 57% menor a los ocho años y el riesgo de muerte por cáncer de mama era un 20% menor en las mujeres tratadas en unidades especializadas.\n",
            "Y que concluimos que el manejo quirúrgico adecuado de los centros de la mama es fundamental para mejorar el desenlace del cáncer de mama, independientemente de dónde se haga.\n",
            "Recuerden que esto se publicó en 2004 y desde entonces el sistema sanitario británico ha desarrollado centros oncológicos mucho más grandes y una regionalización del cáncer de mama sobre la que quizá el profesor Audisio quiera comentar.\n",
            "Pero aquí en los Estados Unidos también hubo varios artículos en ese momento que mostraban que el volumen quirúrgico afecta la supervivencia si los cirujanos realizan al menos quince o más operaciones de cáncer de mama al año y que con la especialización quirúrgica (aquellos entrenados en cirugía oncológica de la mama u oncología quirúrgica) hubo una reducción del 36% en el riesgo de muerte a los cinco años incluso después de ajustar según el volumen hospitalario, el volumen quirúrgico, la edad, el estadio y la raza de la paciente.\n",
            "Y he aquí algunos ejemplos que he seleccionado para el New England Journal of Medicine —estudios clásicos que muestran la relación entre el volumen hospitalario y la mortalidad quirúrgica en los Estados Unidos y nos muestra que para la colectomía, una operación más estándar, no hubo una diferencia comparando el volumen hospitalario y la mortalidad ajustada sin embargo, hubo una diferencia significativa en la mortalidad relacionada con el tratamiento después de la cirugía en el caso de la gastrectomía, esofagectomía y resecciones pancreáticas.\n",
            "Continuando, en otro artículo que analiza el volumen del cirujano, el último artículo se centraba en el volumen del hospital.El volumen del cirujano y la mortalidad quirúrgica, de nuevo hubo algunas operaciones como, atendiendo a la mortalidad quirúrgica ajustada, no hubo mucha diferencia en la resección en casos de cáncer de pulmón o la cistectomía, pero hubo una diferencia muy significativa al comparar el volumen del cirujano y la mortalidad quirúrgica en la esofagectomía y las resecciones pancreáticas.\n",
            "Esta diapositiva es un paréntesis, sólo para recordarles que sus opiniones son importantes, pueden hacer preguntas y enviar comentarios haciendo clic en el botón Preguntas y respuestas y enviando sus preguntas para que al final de esta conferencia el profesor Audisio y yo podamos moderar un debate con sus preguntas.\n",
            "Volviendo a mi ponencia, quería señalar que el volumen del hospital o del cirujano no siempre es lo más importante, que los factores de riesgo del paciente también son importantes y he mostrado algunas fotos de mis viajes a África o incluso de mi propia experiencia personal de pacientes que han descuidado sus tumores o que han recibido un tratamiento inadecuado al principio y sufren al final metástasis regionales extensas que podrían haberse controlado si la cirugía hubiera sido más completa o se hubiera realizado en un momento anterior en el curso de la enfermedad del paciente.\n",
            "Esto sirve para mostrar que el estadio clínico y la comorbilidad de los pacientes, especialmente entre los pacientes de edad avanzada, también marcarán una diferencia en el resultado.\n",
            "Así que como resumen de algunos de estos artículos del New England Journal of Medicine y de todas las publicaciones de otras publicaciones, si se compara la mortalidad postoperatoria en centros especializados, en comparación con los hospitales locales de los Estados Unidos, no hubo diferencia en diversos tumores que afectan a la mama, melanoma, ovario, próstata, tiroides y útero.\n",
            "Sin embargo, se encontraron diferencias entre los pacientes de alto riesgo al comparar los centros especializados con los hospitales locales, lo que muestra que para los pacientes de máximo y alto riesgo hubo una diferencia significativa en las especializaciones, mientras que en los pacientes de bajo riesgo no hubo diferencia entre los centros especializados y los hospitales locales.\n",
            "Y por último, hubo una diferencia en todos los pacientes, en estas dos áreas, páncreas y esófago, al comparar la mortalidad postoperatoriaLo que demuestra que independientemente de los factores de riesgo de los pacientes, los pacientes tratados en centros especializados presentaron una reducción significativa en la mortalidad postoperatoria en estas dos afecciones.\n",
            "Y he aquí otro artículo del Dr. Birkmeyer en el New England Journal of Medicine, que muestra de nuevo la mortalidad hospitalaria, basada tanto en el volumen del cirujano como en el volumen hospitalario, que muestra diferencias muy significativas al relacionar volumen y resultado con respecto a la mortalidad relacionada con la cirugía a los 30 días.\n",
            "El Colegio Estadounidense de Cirujanos ha lanzado en un programa NSQIP un programa nacional de mejora de la calidad quirúrgica, para el cual la mayoría de los hospitales de los Estados Unidos participan en estos programas NSQIP y aquí solo se muestra cuando un programa fue iniciado a nivel nacional y en este caso por el Colegio Estadounidense de Cirujanos, que el 66% de los hospitales, ahora estos son casi todos los hospitales de los Estados Unidos, incluidos los hospitales locales, que el 66% de ellos mejora la mortalidad, el 82% mejora la morbilidad, los peores resultados, es decir, los cirujanos de bajo volumen u hospitales de bajo volumen, tenían más probabilidades de mejorar, pero incluso los que tenían buenos resultados también mejoraron.\n",
            "Y que el número de valores atípicos bajos aumentó y el número de valores atípicos altos disminuyó, lo cual es bueno tomando como base estos programas de calidad iniciados a nivel nacional.\n",
            "Y gracias a este programa, se estimó que cada hospital evitaba 250 complicaciones por año en cada hospital en promedio.\n",
            "De nuevo, quiero que envíen sus preguntas haciendo clic en el botón de Preguntas y respuestas y luego continuaremos en otra área sobre la formación de cirujanos oncológicos.\n",
            "Y aquí hay un punto muy importante, aunque hablamos de oncología quirúrgica y súper especialización, la Junta Americana de Cirugía, que certifica a todos los cirujanos generales y especialidades basadas en cirugía general, incluye la oncología quirúrgica incluyendo la cirugía de cabeza y cuello entre las áreas centrales que se incluyen en sus exámenes de certificación.\n",
            "Por lo tanto, la oncología quirúrgica y el conocimiento del papel de la cirugía en el manejo del cáncer son igualmente importantes para las quemaduras traumáticas, la pediatría vascular, la medicina intensiva y otros criterios.\n",
            "Y yendo más allá, hay dos organizaciones, la Sociedad de Oncología Quirúrgica y la Sociedad Europea de Oncología Quirúrgica, dirigida por el Dr. Chandra Are, aquí en los Estados Unidos, pero incluyendo también al profesor Audisio representando a la ESSO, que publicaron dos importantes artículos el primero mostraba grandes variaciones en la formación de oncólogos quirúrgicos en todo el mundo, y luego proponiendo conjuntamente un plan de estudios global en oncología quirúrgica que puede ser utilizado tanto para la formación de cirujanos generales, como también como recomendaciones curriculares para la formación de especialistas en oncología quirúrgica, que son muy importantes a nivel nacional para el manejo de pacientes muy complejos y para dirigir los programas de formación de cirujanos generales.\n",
            "Y nuestras características curriculares, tanto en los Estados Unidos como en este plan de estudios global, incluyó las características distintivas de los oncólogos quirúrgicos, que abordan operaciones complejas, que forman parte de un equipo multidisciplinario que involucraba la oncología médica y radioterápica en la planificación del tratamiento de los pacientes desde el inicio de su diagnóstico y que participan como oncólogos en el manejo a largo plazo del paciente con cáncer.\n",
            "Y, recientemente, la Junta Americana de Cirugía ha aprobado un nuevo certificado en oncología quirúrgica general compleja, reconociendo que hay una cantidad suficiente de material especializado que justifica una subcertificación independiente en oncología quirúrgica general compleja.\n",
            "Ahora, en un nivel formal, y esto se une a las certificaciones de la Junta en Oncología Médica, Oncología Pediátrica y Oncología Radioterápica, ahora hay una Junta separada para oncología quirúrgica general compleja.\n",
            "Y esta formación de dos años implica una formación adicional en atención multidisciplinaria del cáncer, manejo quirúrgico de enfermedades oncológicas, asesoramiento del paciente sobre prevención e intervención del cáncer y, muy importante, la participación y el liderazgo en investigación clínica y diseño de ensayos clínicos.\n",
            "Y esto incluye cosas que realmente todos los cirujanos generales que tratan el cáncer de mama, por ejemplo y especialmente los oncólogos quirúrgicos que se especializan en cáncer de mama, necesitan saber, cómo usar la ecografía y la biopsia con aguja gruesa.\n",
            "Y digo esto porque en mis viajes a otros países todavía hay muchos centros locales en los que hacer una biopsia abierta, para hacer el diagnóstico del cáncer de mama es el procedimiento habitual.\n",
            "Mientras que en los hospitales especializados y en muchos centros de Europa y Estados Unidos, incluso a nivel local, el procedimiento de referencia consiste en utilizar una biopsia con aguja gruesa en lugar de una biopsia abierta, como tratamiento de elección para las pacientes con un primer diagnóstico de cáncer de mama.\n",
            "Ahora en las siguientes diapositivas, quiero enfatizar lo que es una parte muy importante de las pacientes quirúrgicas, aquí en el cáncer de mama en pacientes que presentan enfermedad en estadio tres, que con quimioterapia simultánea y terapia sistémica y dirigida, las pacientes están logrando una respuesta patológica completa en el 40% al 60% de estas pacientes, y esto va a cambiar la forma de tratar a las pacientes quirúrgicamente porque la cirugía puede no ser la primera modalidad de tratamiento.\n",
            "Aquí, en el cáncer de mama en los Estados Unidos, la mayoría de las pacientes con cáncer de mama en estadio dos y estadio tres y creo que en muchos centros de Europa, especialmente para el estadio tres, la terapia sistémica es el primer tratamiento y luego la cirugía es el segundo tratamiento, así que hay muchas planificaciones diferentes que tenemos que hacer con nuestros colegas de oncología médica con respecto al momento de la cirugía, el papel del ganglio centinela que es diferente en este contexto; pero esto representa el futuro de nuestros tratamientos para muchas enfermedades para las que el cáncer de mama es el prototipo que cambiará.\n",
            "Pero aquí hay otro ejemplo, un paciente con melanoma avanzado con gran masa tumoral e irresecable en la ingle y la pelvis, que fue tratado con inmunoterapia y después de la inmunoterapia tuvo una reducción tal que facilitó la operación, y de hecho en este paciente, cuando se extrajeron todas estas masas (todas contenían inflamación crónica y cicatriz), este paciente tuvo una respuesta patológica completa que no se habría podido lograr sin la resección quirúrgica de las masas tumorales que originalmente se detectaron.\n",
            "Así que el futuro de la terapia sistémica para el cáncer está cambiando drásticamente, hay terapias más efectivas y de hecho muchas de las nuevas terapias van a ser terapias orales que son mucho menos tóxicas y van a repercutir en el paciente quirúrgico.\n",
            "A continuación se presenta un ejemplo de los nuevos fármacos orales o subcutáneos disponibles para diversos tipos de cáncer.\n",
            "Solo para darles algunos ejemplos, estos son los ejemplos más drásticos, pero se están volviendo más típicos.\n",
            "Se trata de un paciente que tenía un melanoma metastásico extenso que incluso después de dos semanas de tratamiento se puede ver que la PET/TAC mostró reducciones drásticas de este tumor extenso.\n",
            "Y estos agentes son tan potentes que ya se están empezando a aplicar en pacientes con melanoma en estadio tres.\n",
            "El otro gran avance que está ocurriendo es el uso de inmunoterapia con los nuevos inhibidores de los puntos de control, que ahora actúan en más de 17 tipos diferentes de cáncer, y esto representa nuestro futuro que se utilizará cada vez más en pacientes quirúrgicos.\n",
            "Pero sólo para darles algunos ejemplos individuales para que tengan una idea del futuro de la terapia, he aquí un ejemplo de una metástasis de melanoma muy grande, que después de una dosis única de inmunoterapia combinada este paciente tuvo una respuesta patológica completa, demostrada por la resección quirúrgica del tejido restante.\n",
            "Y este es quizás un ejemplo más famoso, nuestro presidente estadounidense Jimmy Carter, esto es en la esfera pública, que presentó metástasis hepáticas y cerebrales. Y a los 92 años fue tratado durante un corto intervalo con una dosis única de un inhibidor del punto de control anti pd1.\n",
            "Ahora lleva libre de la enfermedad y en remisión completa durante más de catorce meses, con este agente único en un paciente que es muy mayor y toleró este tratamiento.\n",
            "Quería mostrar otro ejemplo más de un paciente con cáncer de cabeza y cuello que tenía 96 años, enfermedad extensa e incluso después de cuatro semanas con esta terapia anti pd1 única tuvo una respuesta drástica.\n",
            "Así que, si vemos este tipo de respuestas al tratamiento en pacientes con enfermedad más avanzada, pueden estar seguros de que esto se llevará al tratamiento de pacientes con enfermedad más incipiente, como el cáncer en estadio dos y estadio tres.\n",
            "Entonces, como cirujanos en ejercicio, ¿cómo vamos a mantenernos al día en estos campos de rápido avance, tanto en terapia sistémica, radioterapia como en los avances tecnológicos en el quirófano y los nuevos avances en los biomarcadores utilizados para seleccionar pacientes para estos diferentes tratamientos?\n",
            "Y aquí, una vez más, esto está sucediendo de formas muy variadas, con reuniones en vivo, especialmente las realizadas por la SSO y la ESSO y BASO, pero también a través de afiliaciones con centros de atención especializada como en mi institución, con hospitales locales, con avances en revistas, con colaboraciones por correo electrónico o con seminarios web en vivo, como este seminario web que está llevando a cabo el Instituto Europeo de Oncología.\n",
            "El Dr. Audisio y yo somos los redactores jefe de nuestras dos respetadas revistas y se las recomendamos, para mantenerse al día en este campo, tanto en la versión en línea como en la versión impresa.\n",
            "La Sociedad de Oncología Quirúrgica también tiene ahora un programa de autoevaluación, que se lleva a cabo para ayudar a los cirujanos a mantenerse al día en el campo de la oncología.\n",
            "Y en los Estados Unidos usamos cada vez más la telemedicina, que se integra cada vez más en las operaciones en curso de los departamentos de especialidades de hospitales, agencias de salud domiciliaria, consultorios médicos privados, y en algunos casos incluso con fines educativos en el hogar del consumidor.\n",
            "Así, la telemedicina se usa cada vez más no sólo en Estados Unidos sino en todo el mundo, tanto para la formación médica de los médicos, especialmente de los de centros locales y de las zonas más rurales, como para los servicios de consulta especializada, sobre todo para ayudar en la toma de decisiones de atención por parte del paciente, en otros lugares o incluso en otros países.\n",
            "La tecnología nos permite ahora ver con alta resolución imágenes de radiografías, imágenes de patología, e incluso hacerlo, ver en tiempo real imágenes de ecografía, que se están llevando a cabo en otro sitio y se están transmitiendo electrónicamente a un sitio central mediante telemedicina.\n",
            "Incluso he participado en una compañía llamada Cancer Expert Now, soy el Presidente de Cancer Expert Now International, donde hacemos interconsultas con otros médicos.\n",
            "Aquí se muestra un ejemplo mediante telemedicina, de uno de nuestros neurooncólogos haciendo una interconsulta con un médico en otro país sobre un paciente complicado con un tumor cerebral.\n",
            "Y este es sólo otro ejemplo donde estuve en Huangshan, China, e hicimos un comité virtual de telemedicina sobre tumores aquí con la Dra. Hope Rugo, que estaba en San Francisco en ese momento, para hablar sobre una paciente complicada con cáncer de mama.\n",
            "Y aquí está, justo después de esto, una videoconferencia en la misma ubicación, sobre un paciente complejo de cáncer de colon con el Dr. Glen Balch que es jefe de cirugía colorrectal en Emory en Atlanta.\n",
            "Nuevamente mostrando las ilustraciones de cómo los comités virtuales sobre tumores pueden ser utilizados para ayudar en el asesoramiento y recomendaciones para pacientes con cáncer complejo, ahora en cualquier parte del mundo.\n",
            "Y he incluido esta diapositiva, de un resumen que se presentó el año pasado en la ASCO, que muestra que el 91% de los asistentes a comités virtuales sobre tumores lo consideraron muy útil, y el 100% de los asistentes notaron que la calidad de la atención mejoraba.\n",
            "Muy bien, y de nuevo estamos casi terminando nuestra charla, voy a hacer el resumen en breve.\n",
            "Y solo como recordatorio para utilicen los botones de Preguntas y respuestas a medida que resumo.\n",
            "Entonces, como cirujanos ¿cómo nos adaptamos a un cambio en pacientes oncológicos que cambian rápidamente?\n",
            "Está claro en los Estados Unidos y creo que en muchas partes de Europa y en otros lugares del mundo que muchos pacientes de cáncer recibirán más de una modalidad de tratamiento, y que la atención del cáncer contemporánea es un enfoque de equipo, que combina la sabiduría colectiva de cirujanos, oncólogos médicos, oncólogos radioterápicos y otras veces con su patología y oncología radioterápica.\n",
            "Con los avances en la terapia sistémica eficaz es evidente que el cáncer se está convirtiendo en una enfermedad crónica o curable.\n",
            "El cáncer de mama es un muy buen ejemplo de ello.\n",
            "Y después de todos estos tratamientos intensivos, la supervivencia en pacientes que viven durante años después de su tratamiento están en riesgo de sufrir de segundas neoplasias primarias, cumplimiento del tratamiento y las consecuencias de su tratamiento intensivo multidisciplinario.\n",
            "El campo de la oncología es una de las especialidades que más rápidamente avanza y cambia en toda la medicina, y eso significa que nosotros como cirujanos tenemos que mantenernos al día a través de la formación continua e incorporar estos cambios en el plan de estudios de nuestros alumnos.\n",
            "Y también es importante validar estos avances en pacientes quirúrgicos sistemáticamente a través de ensayos clínicos.\n",
            "Y como he tratado de enfatizar, hay una colaboración continua de organizaciones profesionales, especialmente en los Estados Unidos, en Europa, en la formación continua de médicos, que tiene que ocurrir permanentemente, y para mejorar el plan de estudios de los cirujanos generales y las especialidades de cirugía general en todas las instituciones del mundo.\n",
            "Los cirujanos para lograr un mejor resultado van a tener que dividir a sus pacientes e identificar aquellos para los que la especialización o derivación a centros de alto volumen especializados en ciertas enfermedades tendrá un mejor resultado para el tratamiento de pacientes con cánceres complejos o avanzados.\n",
            "Y existe una demanda pública e incluso gubernamental de obtener una atención óptima de especialistas, de centros oncológicos multidisciplinarios y de la regionalización de la terapia oncológica.\n",
            "Sin embargo, es importante enfatizar que esto no significa que todos los pacientes con cáncer necesiten ser tratados por especialistas, especialmente si el diagnóstico se hace pronto y el tratamiento es estándar y no necesita múltiples especialidades para su atención.\n",
            "Realmente creemos que los pacientes deben permanecer en su entorno local todo lo posible, y aquí es donde cosas como la telemedicina pueden desempeñar un papel para ayudar a garantizar que los pacientes, incluso en un hospital local más pequeño, reciban asesoramiento y planificación del tratamiento, con aportaciones de especialistas a través de la telemedicina o la interconsulta.\n",
            "Y que quienes nos especializamos como oncólogos quirúrgicos, deberíamos ser líderes en formación e investigación entre la comunidad de cirugía general.\n",
            "Ya casi termino con mi charla; en resumen, las sociedades profesionales, como la sociedad que represento, la Sociedad de Oncología Quirúrgica y antes fui Director Ejecutivo de ASCO, la SSO europea, el Colegio Americano de Cirujanos, la ASCO, son ejemplos de organizaciones que pueden ser componentes importantes para definir los estándares para tratar pacientes quirúrgicos con cáncer y proporcionar formación, capacitación, talleres para ayudar a otros cirujanos a lograr una atención óptima del cáncer.\n",
            "Y que las asociaciones entre sus sociedades profesionales, que están bien desarrolladas entre los europeos en las organizaciones estadounidenses de SSO, mejorarán nuestra especialidad y la atención de nuestros pacientes.\n",
            "Así que esa es mi conclusión, ahora voy a pasar el testigo al profesor Audisio para escuchar sus comentarios y para responder cualquier pregunta que puedan haber hecho durante esta exposición.\n",
            "Muchas gracias.\n",
            "Gracias Charles, no tenemos palabras para agradecerle al profesor Balch por resumir el presente y el futuro de la cirugía oncológica de buena calidad en todo el mundo.\n",
            "Y realmente quiero decir todo el mundo porque no es sólo el procedimiento quirúrgico sofisticado, súper avanzado que se podría esperar de un centro de referencia de asistencia especializada avanzada, esta es una filosofía, esta es una actitud muy básica, que todos deberíamos adoptar incluso en un hospital general comarcal, hay espacio y hay necesidad de cierto tipo de cirujano, que sea consciente de la multidisciplinariedad de la práctica oncológica, y que fuera más propenso a hablar con diferentes especialistas, para luego ofrecer a sus propios pacientes el tratamiento más adecuado.\n",
            "Entonces ¿estoy en lo correcto al decir, Profesor Balch, que el mensaje con el que hay que quedarse es que la cirugía oncológica de buena calidad es algo que se espera, que se demanda y que es una necesidad mundial no sólo de las principales unidades oncológicas, sino también de la todos los hospitales comarcales?\n",
            "Eso es absolutamente cierto y creo que las organizaciones profesionales y los gobiernos de cada país tienen que insistir en que sus ciudadanos reciban atención de alta calidad y asegurar, en cada país, que haya cirujanos bien formados, que haya sistemas organizativos, como centros oncológicos regionales, y creo cada vez más que hay relaciones internacionales con personas u organizaciones, centros médicos y centros oncológicos, que pueden ser de ayuda para la interconsulta en pacientes complejos, y en la formación de los cirujanos en las comunidades locales e incluso en los centros oncológicos más provinciales o nacionales en los hospitales.\n",
            "Por ejemplo, la semana que viene voy a formar un comité multidisciplinario sobre tumores con un hospital provincial de China, y parte del tema a tratar va a ser cómo podemos aumentar el uso de la videoconferencia para aumentar el acceso de los médicos en China con expertos para ayudar en la toma intelectual de decisiones para pacientes oncológicos complejos.\n",
            "Creo que este es un tema muy candente y tal vez debamos dedicar un poco más de tiempo a pensar la mejor manera de facilitar esto.\n",
            "Acabamos, acaba usted de señalar cómo esa red existe, y yo animaría a los jóvenes cirujanos en formación a que se sientan absolutamente libres de perseguir sus sueños, estudiar sus temas, y cuando se encuentren con el gran profesor en la reunión le tiren de la manga y, y, contacten con especialistas, especialistas de primer nivel, y que luego se sientan libres de comunicarse con ellos, tal vez entablen con ellos un debate y se sientan lo suficientemente cómodos como para aprovechar la gran red que está disponible a través de la SSO, la Sociedad Estadounidense de Oncología Quirúrgica, y la europea también; estamos trabajando en este momento para facilitársela a estos países en desarrollo en África, a través del fondo no restringido que las compañías farmacéuticas están poniendo a disposición, este es, en mi opinión, el camino a seguir.\n",
            "Así que los animo a venir y hablar con el profesor Balch, conmigo mismo, y con quien quieran para mejorar sus conocimientos.\n",
            "Creo que lo importante es que no podemos obligar a estos cambios, la iniciativa tiene que venir del cirujano en cada comunidad, de su hospital, y de su gobierno, tanto su gobierno local como su gobierno nacional, para elevar el nivel de expectativas para una atención de alta calidad y oportuna.\n",
            "Y luego trabajar en cada país dentro de las limitaciones de sus recursos, para lograrlo con el tiempo.\n",
            "Hagamos también alguna advertencia, algo fácil de entender sobre técnicas súper avanzadas, es decir, no quieres un escáner PET, cuando no tienes un ecógrafo.\n",
            "Podrías no plantearte comprar un equipo robótico, cuando te falta un aparato básico de laparoscopia, y por lo tanto necesitas desarrollar el sistema, como usted dice, paso a paso, de acuerdo con las instalaciones locales a nivel regional o provincial.\n",
            "Sí, es absolutamente cierto; he estado en un hospital importante en África que tiene una máquina de radioterapia muy cara que aún está en cajas porque no tienen los radiólogos o los técnicos en radiología para el componente de servicio, pero tienen la máquina en una caja, que alguien compró, pero no basta con eso.\n",
            "Así que se necesita planificación a nivel gubernamental y hospitalario, para asegurarse de definir no sólo los gastos financieros en edificios y equipos sino también la ejecución de los servicios por individuos calificados y entrenados, a todos los niveles.\n",
            "Así, Profesor Balch, siempre tenemos enemigos y aliados cuando queremos lograr un objetivo, y esa es una forma tonta y restrictiva de verlo, pero ha ocurrido que la mayoría de los oncólogos quirúrgicos culpen a los cirujanos generales por no adoptar una actitud o filosofía oncológica y, por otro lado, algunos oncólogos médicos están barriendo las habilidades de los cirujanos hasta esconderlas bajo la alfombra.\n",
            "¿Estamos en lo cierto al decir que realmente necesitamos a todos y les damos la bienvenida a todos a bordo, porque este es un debate en curso que es un placer crear juntos a medida que se desarrolla?\n",
            "Estoy de acuerdo, y creo que el punto aquí es que el cirujano tiene que estar involucrado en la planificación del tratamiento.\n",
            "Como usted y yo hemos comentado hay otras especialidades y cirujanos que pasan todo su tiempo en el quirófano, y permiten que el profesional con formación en medicina interna se ponga al frente y tome todas las decisiones y ahora en esa especialidad, y estoy hablando de cirugía cardíaca, el cirujano es el tribunal de último recurso, después de que todos los tratamientos médicos hayan fracasado.\n",
            "Y me preocupa que si el cirujano no aporta la perspectiva quirúrgica a la planificación del tratamiento, y está involucrado con el oncólogo médico y el oncólogo radioterápico, los pacientes podrían no obtener todas las ventajas de un verdadero enfoque de tratamiento multidisciplinario que implique cirugía, pero estamos mejor entrenados y tenemos la experiencia para determinar cuál es el mejor momento de la cirugía en determinada combinación y secuencia.\n",
            "Si no estamos sentados a la mesa, seremos el tribunal de último recurso después de que todo lo demás fracase con el tratamiento médico y la radioterapia.\n",
            "Así que tenemos que participar en la planificación del tratamiento desde el principio.\n",
            "Sí, bueno, una vez más adoptamos totalmente una actitud multidisciplinaria, donde cada vez más y más y quizás nuevas figuras están tomando parte, por ejemplo, pienso en radiólogos intervencionistas que hace tan sólo tal vez una o dos décadas eran casi desconocidos, pero hoy en día están las estenosis de endoprótesis vasculares, ellos colocan catéteres, administran medicación e isótopos, así que una vez más vamos a reiterar claramente la idea de que queremos a todos a bordo aquí.\n",
            "Aprovecho el tiempo porque entiendo por parte del organizador que hay un problema con la recepción de las preguntas y este servicio no ha estado disponible hoy, hay un fallo técnico.\n",
            "Así que nos disculparemos por esto y nos aseguraremos de que si tienen alguna pregunta puedan regresar, la audiencia puede contactar conmigo y con el profesor Balch por escrito y nos complacerá responderles o satisfacer cualquier solicitud.\n",
            "Pero me complace mucho ser parte de esta importante sesión y unirme a usted, un oncólogo quirúrgico de renombre internacional, en este foro educativo por videoconferencia.\n",
            "También estoy muy agradecido a la Escuela Europea de Oncología, porque a menudo sentimos que el equipo quirúrgico está un poco descuidado, así que me gustaría felicitar a la ESO por esto y quizás, en fin, retorcerles el brazo y asegurarse de que se otorgue más espacio y más interés a lo que están haciendo los cirujanos.\n",
            "¿Hay alguna nota concluyente que quiera destacar, profesor Balch?\n",
            "Sí, me gustaría que me dieran la última palabra, mostré a propósito las diapositivas sobre el tratamiento del cáncer de mama en Gran Bretaña, una región de niveles altos de renta.\n",
            "Y tengo entendido que después de esa época alrededor del año 2002-2004, el gobierno británico se puso manos a la obra para desarrollar los centros oncológicos, la regionalización y que la atención en el cáncer de mama ha mejorado enormemente.\n",
            "Usted se mueve en ese ámbito y ha sido testigo de ello, ahora me pregunto si le gustaría comentar algo, porque una de las cuestiones importantes para nosotros es que se necesita cierto nivel de especialización, incluso en el cáncer de mama.\n",
            "Está bien, voy a compartir mis opiniones con usted y los participantes.\n",
            "Estoy seguro de que, espero no ofender a nadie, pero la historia dice que, cuando llegué a este país en 1999, la cirugía de mama estaba en manos de los cirujanos más torpes, quizás no estaban muy capacitados para una cirugía visceral, así que quedaban relegados a cirugías de cáncer subcutáneo.\n",
            "Y por lo tanto, los resultados estéticos fueron terribles, y los resultados oncológicos también fueron muy, muy deficientes.\n",
            "Y en esos días, todavía éramos presa de los egos, que usted sabe que los cirujanos lo pueden todo, o usted no lo necesita, yo le he curado, no necesita quimio, no necesita radio, solo regrese dentro de seis meses, de un año, y está arreglado.\n",
            "Ahora, afortunadamente, ha habido un deseo, una decisión de crear cirujanos especializados en la mama.\n",
            "Los viejos se han retirado y ahora hay cada vez más jóvenes que realmente se centran solamente en el cáncer de mama.\n",
            "Y esto significa que no hacen guardias nocturnas, simplemente se centran en la cirugía del cáncer de mama.\n",
            "También profesor Audisio, ¿no es cierto que se han establecido centros de oncología regionales que, no solo para el cáncer de mama, sino para otras enfermedades, ha elevado la calidad de la atención?\n",
            "Sí, definitivamente, esto es especialmente cierto para la cirugía de cáncer avanzado, como señaló usted, la cirugía hepática, la cirugía pancreática, los sarcomas, la enfermedad peritoneal; no tiene sentido tener veinte unidades en todo el país, tenemos cuatro unidades acreditadas totalmente auditadas, y muy bien controladas y con un rendimiento maravilloso, así que ese es el escenario.\n",
            "Pero el punto que quería dejar claro es que creo que la generación joven está aceptando, como decía usted antes, la idea de trabajar juntos y decidir: sí, esto es una cuestión quirúrgica, pero ¿en qué momento? ¿en qué pacientes? ¿cuán agresivos deberíamos ser?\n",
            "¿Y qué queda después de la cirugía?\n",
            "Y, definitivamente, estamos mejorando en esto y los resultados están ahí, los resultados del cáncer han mejorado.\n",
            "No estoy seguro de que pueda citarlo debido a la, esto, la creación del equipo multidisciplinario, pero es indudablemente cierto que esta filosofía cohesionada, este abordaje armónico de los pacientes con cáncer ha mejorado extraordinariamente los resultados.\n",
            "Sí, y creo que la enseñanza, el resumen de toda esta charla es que los cirujanos tienen que desempeñar un papel en este campo de rápido avance y que lamentablemente miles de millones de personas no tienen acceso a una atención segura, asequible y oportuna.\n",
            "Y creo que todos nosotros tenemos que intensificar nuestros esfuerzos para ayudar a los pacientes de cáncer de todo el mundo, para que, independientemente de dónde vivan, puedan tener acceso, ya sea a través de un médico local más formado y capacitado o mediante la derivación a un centro regional.\n",
            "Y que el proceso formativo se mejore en todos los países para que todos podamos estar al día en este campo en rápido crecimiento y podamos introducir de manera segura estas nuevas terapias, a medida que estén aprobadas por los gobiernos y los planes de seguros.\n",
            "Le estoy muy agradecido Profesor Balch por su tiempo, por su sabia visión y por compartir sus pensamientos con nosotros.\n",
            "Solo quiero decirles grazie molte, grazie, ciao ciao, arrivederci, grazie Gracias Profesor Balch y gracias Profesor Audisio.\n",
            "Damas y caballeros, la sesión ha concluido.\n",

Barge, del Centro de Cáncer MD Anderson de la Universidad de Texas en Houston, Texas, Estados Unidos.', 'Ahora le entregaremos la palabra a la profesora Barj.', 'Profesor, su línea está ahora abierta.', 'Hola a todos,', \"This is Charles Balch from Houston, Texas, and I'm pleased to join this webinar to talk about the impact of oncologic surgical outcomes. And I'm also involved in this is my good friend, Professor Ricardo Adisicio, the past president of the British Society of Surgical Oncology and the president-elect of the European Society of Surgical Oncology, and he will lead a question and answer period at the end of my presentation.\", \"So I'll go briefly through my slides, but I'm hoping that you will download at a future time several papers that I think are seminal papers involving surgeons around the world. And these come from the Lancet Commission that were published in 2015 in Lancet Oncology.\", \"The first of which was about global surgery in the year 2030. And I'll just give a few quotes from these papers.\", 'The first is access to surgical care is essential for reduction of mortality and morbidity from surgical conditions. However, and this is really an important fact and a startling one, more than two billion people have no access to surgery and anesthesia. And, moreover, this figure is probably an underestimate.', 'so universal access to safe affordable surgical care is essential', 'In a subsequent paper that Dr. Adisio and I were involved in in Lancet Oncology, focused on global cancer surgery and how to deliver safe, affordable and timely cancer surgery. And I would really commend this paper for all of you who are listening to read.', 'Así que este artículo fue publicado en Lancet Oncology en 2015. Y, como se puede ver de los flechas, Dr. Odishio y yo fuimos coautores de este. Y parte del resumen, que destacaré brevemente, indicó que para el año 2013, es decir, solo 13 años después, estimamos que se necesitarán 45 millones de procedimientos quirúrgicos en todo el mundo. Y, sin embargo, menos del 25% de los pacientes con cáncer en todo el mundo reciben cirugía segura, asequible y oportuna.', \"So there's much work to be done here. And just a few more quotes from this paper in Lancet Oncology that issues of access to surgery, a paucity of investment in public surgical systems, low investment in research and training in surgery, and educational gaps are remarkably widespread globally.\", \"And we offered up solutions that include a better regulated public system, especially in the training and certification of surgeons, international partnerships, super centralization of surgical services, and I'll come back to that later, novel surgical clinical trials, and new approaches to improve quality and scale up of cancer surgical systems through education and training.\", \"and i'll give some examples of that later in this lecture\", 'So going on with a few more summary statements from this important paper, achieving good outcomes in modern cancer surgery is technically demanding, and it is recognized that outcomes improve when such surgery is undertaken by specialized teams in high-volume centers.', \"And I'll go into this important strategy in more detail, but with the emphasis that we're talking about the more complicated patients, the more complicated operations, and in high-volume centers.\", \"But I think what's important as a summary is that access to high-quality training in these units with suitable accreditation and quality control for aspiring oncologic surgeons has yet to be formally met by regulatory authorities in actually quite a number of countries.\", 'And although high-income countries, such as many countries in Europe and in the United States, are driving greater specialization, globally, there is a need for surgeons with much wider training. The surgical professional societies must play an enhanced role in this area. And finally, that high-income and middle-income countries have a duty and an opportunity to expand their educational offerings on cancer surgery to low-income countries through bilateral exchanges, a greater use of technology-enhanced learning, and partnerships to develop specific curriculum content on cancer into general surgery residency training programs.', \"These are some examples of the partnerships and availability of global programs in education, including the Society of Surgical Oncology, the European Society, the British Association, and several other organizations such as ESMO, ASCO, and a group that I'm involved in called Health Volunteers Overseas that's based in the United States.\", 'Ahora, en estas próximas diapositivas, quiero enfatizar la importancia y el valor en términos de atención de calidad en especialización.', 'There has been a rapid and substantial advances in cancer research with new diagnostics and biomarkers, new systemic therapies including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy and more recently, immunotherapy.', 'and this has led to new combinations and sequences of cancer treatments including neo-adjuvant and adjuvant therapies in the surgical patients', 'So all of us in surgery has to keep up with these rapidly advancing fields.', 'There are major advances in surgical technologies in the operating room as well, such as laparoscopic surgery, robotic surgery, and intraoperative imaging techniques. And the question is then, how can we excise cancer with better and safer results, with lower incidence of complications, and better local regional control, and the importance in addition of rehabilitation and restoring function to patients after surgery.', 'And there are many changes now in the delivery of cancer care through the regional concept of cancer centers, a multidisciplinary team of oncologic specialists, which have to include surgeons who choose to spend part of their time as part of a multidisciplinary team and participating in treatment planning with our colleagues in medical, radiation, oncology, pathology, and radiology.', \"and i'll show just a few slides of evidence that high-volume cancer centers and surgical specialists have better outcomes for treating complex cancers\", 'Y como voy a mencionar de nuevo, al final de esto, esto no significa para las operaciones rutinarias y los pacientes rutinarios que necesitan especializarse, porque necesitamos cirujanos generales que practiquen cirugía de alta calidad y segura, pero tiene el juicio de saber cuándo algunos pacientes deben ser transferidos a un centro regional donde podrían obtener mejores resultados.', 'Y para mostrarles un ejemplo de una enfermedad común, esta fue una publicación en el British Journal of Cancer en 2004, en la que citaré que las pacientes con cáncer de mama tratadas por especialistas, en comparación con unidades no especialistas, tenían la mitad de riesgo de tratamiento inadecuado de la mama y un riesgo cinco veces menor de cirugía axilar inadecuada y un riesgo nueve veces menor de tratamiento axilar inadecuado. Y que en realidad, las tasas de recurrencia local, que es una métrica de los resultados quirúrgicos, fue 57% más baja a los ocho años, y el riesgo de muerte por cáncer de mama era 20% menor para las mujeres tratadas en unidades especialistas.', 'and that we conclude that adequate surgical management of breast centers is fundamental to improving the outcome for breast cancer irrespective of where it is delivered', 'Now, remember, this was published in 2004, and since then, the British healthcare system has really developed much greater cancer centers and regionalization of breast cancer, which perhaps Professor Adesso may want to comment on.', 'Pero aquí en los Estados Unidos, también había un número de artículos en ese momento que mostraban que el volumen quirúrgico impacta la supervivencia. Si los cirujanos realizan al menos 15 o más operaciones de cáncer de mama por año, y que con la especialización quirúrgica, aquellos entrenados en cirugía de mama, oncología o oncología quirúrgica, había una reducción del 36% en el riesgo de muerte a los cinco años, incluso después de ajustar por el volumen del hospital, el volumen quirúrgico, la edad, el estadio y la raza del paciente.', \"And here are just a few examples that I selected from the New England Journal of Medicine classic studies showing the relationship between hospital volume and surgical mortality in the United States. And the teaching point here is for colectomy, a more standard operation, there wasn't a difference comparing hospital volume and adjusted mortality. However, there was a significant difference in treatment-related mortality after surgery for gastrectomy, esophagectomy, and pancreatic resection.\", \"And going on in another paper looking at surgeon volume, the last paper was on hospital volume, surgeon volume and operative mortality. Again, there were some operations such as we're looking at adjusted operative mortality. There was not much different in resection for lung cancer or for cystectomy, but there was a highly significant difference comparing surgeon volume and operative mortality for esophagectomy and pancreas resection.\", 'Now, this is an interlude slide just to remind you that your views are important. You can ask questions and send comments by clicking on the Q&A button and sending in your questions. So at the end of this lecture, Professor Adesso and I can lead a discussion with your questions.', \"But getting back to my lecture, I wanted to point out that volume, be it hospital or surgeon volume, isn't always the most important thing, that patient risk factors are important as well. And I've shown some photos, either from my travels in Africa or even from my own personal experience of patients who have neglected their tumors or they've had inadequate treatment at the beginning and suffer at the end with extensive regional metastasis that might have been controlled had surgery been more complete or done at an earlier time in the course of the patient's disease.\", 'so this is just illustrating that patient stage presentation and comorbidity of patients especially among older patients will also make a difference in outcome', 'So in summary from some of these papers from the New England Journal of Medicine and other publications, if one is comparing the post-operative mortality in specialized centers comparing community hospitals in the United States, there was no difference for a variety of tumors involving breast, melanoma, ovarian, prostate, thyroid, and uterus.', 'Sin embargo, hubo diferencias entre pacientes de alto riesgo comparando los centros especializados con los hospitales comunitarios, mostrando que para los pacientes de mayor riesgo y alto riesgo, hubo una diferencia significativa en especializaciones. Mientras que en pacientes de bajo riesgo, no hubo diferencia entre los centros especializados y los hospitales comunitarios.', \"And finally, there was a difference for all patients for these two areas, pancreas and esophagus, comparing postoperative mortality, showing that regardless of the patient's risk factors, that those patients treated in specialized centers had a significant reduction in postoperative mortality for these two conditions.\", 'And here is just one other paper from Dr. Birkmyre in the New England Journal of Medicine, again showing hospital mortality and both based on surgeon volume and hospital volume, showing highly significant differences of relating volume and outcome with regard to 30-day surgically related mortality.', 'Ahora, la American College of Surgeons ha lanzado un programa de mejora de la calidad quirúrgica nacional, para el cual la mayoría de los hospitales en los Estados Unidos participan en estos programas de NCQP. Y esto solo muestra que cuando se inicia un programa a nivel nacional, y en este caso, por la American College of Surgeons, que el 66% de los hospitales, ahora en los Estados Unidos, incluyendo hospitales comunitarios, que el 66% de ellos mejoraron su mortalidad, el 82% mejoraron su morbabilidad, los que mejoraron menos, es decir, los cirujanos de bajo volumen o los hospitales de bajo volumen, eran más propensos a mejorar, pero incluso los que mejoraron bien también mejoraron.', 'and that the number of low outliers increased and the number of high outliers decreased, which is good based upon the quality programs initiated at a national level.', 'And because of this program, each hospital was estimated to avoid 250 complications per year in each hospital on average.', \"So again, I want you to send in your questions by clicking on the Q&A budget, and then we'll resume in another area about the training of oncologic surgeons.\", 'And here is a very important point, that although we talk about surgical oncology and the super specialization, the American Board of Surgery, which certifies all general surgeons and general surgery-based specialties, includes surgical oncology, including head and neck surgery, among its core areas that are included in its board exams.', 'so surgical oncology and the understanding about the role of surgery in cancer management is equally important to trauma burns vascular pediatrics critical care and other criteria', 'And going beyond that are two organizations, the Society of Surgical Oncology and the European Society of Surgical Oncology, led by Dr. Chandra R here in the United States, but also including Professor DCO representing the ESSO, that published two important papers, the first showing very large variations in the training of surgical oncologists around the world, and then jointly proposing a global curriculum in surgical oncology that can be used both for training general surgeons, but also as curriculum recommendations for training surgical oncology specialists, who are very important at the national level for managing the very complex patients and for leading the training programs of general surgeons.', 'And our curriculum features both in the United States and in these global curriculum included the distinguishing features of surgical oncologists who manage complex operations, who are part of a multidisciplinary team that involve medical and radiation oncology in treatment planning for patients at the outset of their diagnosis and participate as an oncologist in long-term disease management of the cancer patient.', 'And this recently, the American Board of Surgery has approved a new certificate in complex general surgical oncology, acknowledging that there is a sufficient amount of specialized material that justifies a separate sub-board in complex general surgical oncology.', 'now in a formal level and this comes along the board certifications in medical oncology pediatric oncology and radiation oncology there is now a separate board in complex general surgical oncology', 'And this two-year training involves additional training in multidisciplinary cancer care, surgical management of oncologic conditions, patient counseling on cancer prevention and intervention, and very importantly, the participation and leadership in clinical research and clinical trial design.', 'And this includes such things that actually all general surgeons managing breast cancer, for example, and especially those surgical oncologists who specialize in breast cancer, need to know how to use ultrasound and core needle biopsy.', \"and i say this because in my travels to other countries there are still many community-based centers we're doing an open biopsy as to make the diagnosis of breast cancer is the standard of care\", 'Whereas in the specialty hospitals and in many centers in Europe and the United States, even at the community level, the standard of care is to use a core needle biopsy instead of an open biopsy as the preferred treatment for patients with a first diagnosis of breast cancer.', 'Now, in these next few slides, I want to emphasize what is a very important part of the surgical patients here in breast cancer, in patients who present with stage 3 disease, that with contemporary chemotherapy and systemic and targeted therapy, patients are now achieving a pathological complete response in 40 to 60 percent of such patients. And this is going to change how we manage patients surgically, because surgery may not be the first modality of treatment.', 'En el cáncer de mama en los Estados Unidos, la mayoría de los pacientes con cáncer de mama en etapa 2 y etapa 3. Y creo que en muchos centros en Europa, especialmente para la enfermedad en etapa 3, la terapia sistémica es el primer tratamiento, y luego la cirugía es el segundo tratamiento. Así que hay muchos diferentes planes que tenemos que hacer con nuestros colegas en oncología médica sobre el momento de la cirugía, el papel del nódulo sentinela, que es diferente en este contexto. Pero esto representa el futuro de nuestros tratamientos para muchas enfermedades, para las que el cáncer de mama es el prototipo que cambiará.', \"But here's another example. Here is a patient with bulky and unresectable advanced melanoma in the groin and pelvis, who was treated with immunotherapy, and after immunotherapy, had such a shrinkage that it facilitated the operation. And in fact, in this patient, when all these masses were removed, they were all containing chronic inflammation and scar. This patient had a pathological complete response, which could not have been staged without surgical resection of the tumor masses that originally were detected.\", 'So the future of cancer systemic therapy is changing dramatically. There are more effective therapies and in fact many of the new therapies are going to be oral therapies that are much less toxicity and will impact the surgical patients.', 'here is just an example of where new oral or subcutaneous agents are available for a variety of cancer types', 'just to give you some examples these are the more dramatic examples but they are getting to be more typical', 'Este es un paciente que tenía un melanoma metastásico extenso que, incluso después de dos semanas de terapia, se podía ver en el escáner PET-CT. Se ve una reducción dramática en este tumor extenso.', 'and these agents are so powerful they are already beginning to be applied in stage three melanoma patients', 'The other major advance that is happening is the use of immunotherapy with the new checkpoint inhibitors, which now have activity in over 17 different types of cancer. And this does represent our future that will be used increasingly in surgical patients.', 'But just to give you a few individual examples so that you have some idea about the future of therapy, here is an example of a very large melanoma metastasis that after a single dose of combination immunotherapy, this patient had a pathological complete response demonstrated by surgical excision of the remaining tissue.', 'and here is maybe a more famous example our u s president jimmy carter and this is in the public arena presented with liver and brain metastases and at age ninety two was treated for a short interval with a single dose of a anti pd one checkpoint inhibitor', 'He has now been disease-free and in complete remission for over 14 months with this single agent in a patient who is much older and who tolerated this treatment.', 'Quería mostrar, de nuevo, un ejemplo de un paciente con cáncer de cabeza y cuello que tenía 96 años, enfermedad extensa. E incluso después de cuatro semanas con este anti-pd1, una sola terapia tuvo una respuesta dramática.', \"so if we're seeing these kind of treatment responses in patients with more advanced disease you can be sure that this will migrate into the treatment of patients with earlier disease such as stage two and stage three cancers\", 'So how are we as practicing surgeons going to keep up with these rapidly advancing fields, both fields in systemic therapy, radiation therapy, and also technological advances in the operating room and new advances in biomarkers used to select patients for these different treatments?', 'And here again, there are a whole variety of ways that this is happening with live meetings, especially those conducted by the SSO and the ESSO and BASO, but also through affiliations with tertiary centers, such as in my institution, with community hospitals, with advances in journals, with email collaborations, or with live webinars, such as this webinar that is being conducted by the European Institute of Oncology.', 'Both Dr. Adesso and I are the editors-in-chief of our two respective journals, and we would commend those to you for keeping up with the field, both the online version and the print version.', 'the society of surgical oncology also now has a self-assessment program that is conducted to help surgeons keep up with the field in oncology', \"And increasingly, we're using telemedicine in the United States that is increasingly being integrated into the ongoing operations of hospitals, specialty departments, home health agencies, private physician offices, and in some cases, even for educational purposes in the consumer's home.\", 'So telemedicine is increasingly being used not only in the United States, but around the world, both for medical education to physicians, especially those in the community setting and those in more rural areas, and also for specialist consultative services, especially in helping in patient care decision making in other locations or even in other nations.', 'The technology allows us now to, with high resolution, to view images of x-rays, images of pathology, and even to look at ultrasound images real time that are being conducted in another site and transmitted electronically to a central site by telemedicine.', \"I've even been involved in a company called Cancer Expert Now. I'm the president of Cancer Expert Now International, where we do consultation with physicians.\", 'This shows an example by telemedicine of one of our neuro-oncologists doing a consultation with a physician in another country on a complicated patient with a brain tumor.', 'And this shows just another example where I was in Hong Kong, China, and we conducted a telemedicine virtual tumor board here with Dr. Hope Rugo, who was in San Francisco at the time, discussing a complicated patient with breast cancer.', 'Y aquí está, justo después de esto, un televideo en el mismo lugar, en un paciente complejo de cáncer de colon con el Dr. Glenn Bolch, que es el jefe de cirugía de colon y recto en Emory en Atlanta.', 'Again, just showing the illustrations about how virtual tumor boards can be used to help in the advice and recommendations for patients with complex cancer now anywhere in the world.', 'Y yo acabo de incluir esta diapositiva para un resumen que se presentó el año pasado en ASCO, mostrando que el 91% de los asistentes a la mesa redonda virtual lo encontraron muy útil, y el 100% de los asistentes sintieron que la calidad de la atención mejoró.', \"alright and then again we're almost finishing our talk i'm going to do the summary shortly\", 'And just as a reminder to do your Q&A buttons as I summarize.', 'so how do we as surgeons adapt to a change in a rapidly changing cancer patients', 'It is clear in the United States, and I think in many parts of Europe and elsewhere in the world, that many cancer patients will receive more than one modality of treatment, and that contemporary cancer care is a team approach, combining the collective wisdom of surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and oftentimes with their pathology and radiation oncology.', 'it is clear with the advances in effective systemic therapy that cancer is becoming a chronic or curable disease', 'El cáncer de mama es un muy buen ejemplo de eso.', 'And after all of these intensive treatments, survivorships in patients who are living for years after their treatment are at risk for second primaries treatment compliance and the consequences of their intensive multidisciplinary treatment.', 'The oncology field is one of the most rapidly advancing and changing specialties in all of medicine, and that means that we as surgeons have to keep up through continuing education and incorporate these changes into the curriculum of our trainees.', \"And it's also important to validate these advances in surgical patients systematically through clinical trials.\", \"And as I've tried to emphasize, there is a continuing partnerships of professional organizations, especially in the United States and Europe, on physician continuing education that has to occur for a lifetime and in improving the curriculum of general surgeons and general surgery-based specialties in all institutions throughout the world.\", 'Surgeons, in order to achieve a better outcome, are going to need to partition their patients and identify those for which specialization or referral to high volume centers specializing in certain diseases will have a better outcome for treating patients with complex or advanced cancers.', \"and there's both a public and even a government demand for getting optimal care from specialists multidisciplinary cancer centers and regionalization of cancer therapy\", 'Sin embargo, es importante enfatizar que esto no significa que todos los pacientes con cáncer necesiten ser tratados por especialistas, especialmente si se hace un diagnóstico temprano y el tratamiento es estándar y no necesita múltiples especialidades para su atención.', 'We really believe that patients should stay in their local environment as much as possible. And this is where things like telemedicine may have a role in helping ensure that patients, even in a smaller community hospital, are getting advice and treatment planning with input from specialists through telemedicine or consultation.', 'and that those of us who specialize as surgical oncologists should be educational and research leaders among the general surgery community.', 'Ahora estoy casi terminado con mi charla en resumen, que las sociedades profesionales como la sociedad que represento, la Sociedad de Oncología Quirúrgica, y anteriormente yo era CEO de ASCO, la Sociedad Europea de Oncología Quirúrgica, la Sociedad Americana de Cirujanos, ASCO, son ejemplos de organizaciones que pueden ser componentes importantes de definir los estándares para tratar a pacientes quirúrgicos con cáncer y proporcionar educación, capacitación, talleres para ayudar a otros cirujanos a lograr el mejor cuidado del cáncer.', 'and that the partnerships across our professional societies, which is well developed between the Europeans and American SSO organizations, will advance our specialty and improve the care for our patients.', \"So that is my conclusion. We'll now turn this over to Professor Adesso for his comments and to answer any questions that you may have made during this discussion.\", 'Muchas gracias.', 'Thank you, Charles. We have no words to be grateful to Professor Balshe for summarizing the present and the future of good quality cancer surgery worldwide.', 'And I really mean worldwide, because this is not just a sophisticated, super advanced surgical procedure that you might expect from an advanced tertiary referral center. This is a philosophy, this is a very basic attitude that we should all embrace. Even in a district general hospital, there is room and there is need for some kind of surgeons who is aware of the multi-disciplinary of the oncological practice, and he was keen to talk to different specialties and offer his own, his her own patients the most appropriate treatment.', \"So am I right to say, Professor Bals, that the bring home message is that good quality cancer surgery is expected, is demanded, and it's a worldwide need, not just from top cancer units, but from most, from actually all district hospitals as well.\", \"That's absolutely true, and I think the professional organizations and governments in each nation need to insist that their citizens get high quality care and ensure in each nation that there are well trained surgeons, that there are organizational systems such as regional cancer centers. And I think increasingly that there are relationships internationally with individuals or with organizations, medical centers and cancer centers that can be of assistance for consultation and complex patients, and in education of the surgeons in the local communities and even in the more provincial or national cancer centers and hospitals.\", \"For example, next week that I'm doing a multidisciplinary tumor board with a provincial hospital in China. And part of our theme is going to be how we can increase our use of tele-video in order to increase access for the doctors in China with experts to help in the intellectual decision-making for complex cancer patients.\", 'I think this is a very hot topic and perhaps we want to spend a little bit more time on how best to facilitate this.', 'You have just pointed out how the network is there and I would encourage young surgeons in training to feel absolutely free to follow their dreams, study their topics and when they meet the big professor at the meeting, pull the sleeve and contact a specialist, the top specialist and feel free to communicate with them, perhaps engage with them in the discussion and feel comfortable enough to take advantage of the large network that is available through the American Society of Surgical Oncology and the European one as well. We are at the moment working on facilitating this for developing countries in Africa through the unrestricted grant that pharmaceutical companies are making available. This is in my mind the way forward.', 'So I encourage you, um, guys, to, um, um, come and talk to, uh, Professor Bals, to myself and to whoever you want to improve your, uh, knowledge.', \"I think the important point is we can't mandate these changes. The initiative has to come from the surgeon in each community, from their hospital and from their government, both their local government and their national government, to raise the level of expectations for high quality and timely care.\", 'And then work in each nation within the limitations of their resources in order to achieve that over time.', \"Shall we also say a word in warning, some easy bite on super advanced technicalities, i.e. you don't want a PET scan when you don't have a ultrasound machine.\", 'You might consider not purchasing a robotic equipment when you are missing basic laparoscopic stuff. And therefore you need to develop the system, as you were saying, step by step according to the local facilities at the regional, provincial level.', \"Yes, that's absolutely true. I've been in one major hospital in Africa, which has a very expensive radiation therapy machine that is still in boxes because they don't have the radiation physicist or the radiation technicians or the service component. But they have the machine in a box that somebody bought, but it's more than that.\", 'So it takes planning at the government level and at the hospital level to make sure to define not just the capital expenditures of buildings and equipment, but the delivery of the services by qualified and trained individuals at all levels.', \"So, Professor Baggio, we always have enemies and allies when we want to achieve a target. And that's a bit of a silly and restrictive way to look at it, but it has been the case that most surgical oncologists would blame the general surgeons for not embracing an oncological attitude or philosophy. And on the other hand, some medical oncologists are wiping surgeons' skills under the carpet.\", 'Y estamos de acuerdo en decir que en realidad necesitamos a todos y damos la bienvenida a todos a bordo, porque esta es una discusión en curso, que es un placer crear juntos a medida que se desarrolla.', 'i agree and i think the point here is that the surgeon has to be involved in the treatment planning', \"As you and I have talked about, there are other specialties in surgeons who spend all their time in the operating room and allow the internal medicine trained person to get at the front and make all the decisions. And now in that specialty, and I'm talking about cardiac surgery, the surgeon is the court of last resort after all medical treatments have failed.\", \"And my concern that if the surgeon doesn't bring the surgical perspective to the treatment planning and is engaged with the medical oncologist and radiation oncologist, the patients may not get the full advantage of a true multidisciplinary treatment approach that does involve surgery. But we are best trained and have the experience to determine what's the best timing of surgery in some combination and sequence.\", 'Si no estamos en la mesa, seremos el tribunal de último recurso después de que todo lo demás falla con el tratamiento médico y el tratamiento con radiación.', 'So we have to be engaged in the treatment planning at the outset.', \"Yeah, good. So once again, we totally embrace a multidisciplinary attitude where more and more perhaps new figures are taking part. For example, I'm thinking of interventional radiologists that only maybe a decade or two decades ago were almost unknown, but nowadays they stent, they put catheters, they deliver medication and isotopes. And so, once again, let's reiterate the point that we want everyone on board here.\", \"I'm taking advantage of this time because I understand from the organizer that there is a problem with the questions coming in and this has not been made available today. There is a technical hiccup.\", \"So we do apologize for this. And let's make sure that if you have any question, you definitely can come back. The audience can definitely come back to me and Professor Balschi in writing, and we will be pleased to provide any answer or satisfy any request.\", 'Pero estoy muy contento de ser parte de esta importante sesión y de unirme a usted, un cirujano oncólogo internacionalmente reconocido, en este foro educativo por televideo.', 'Estoy muy agradecido con la Escuela Europea de Oncología porque a menudo sentimos que el equipo quirúrgico se está un poco descuidando. Así que me gustaría felicitar a Aizo por esto y tal vez, ya sabes, apretar su brazo y asegurarme de que se dé más espacio y más interés en lo que los cirujanos están haciendo.', '¿Hay alguna nota concluyente que le gustaría subrayar, profesor Balz?', \"yes i'd like you to get the last word i purposely planted these slides about breast cancer management in great britain a high income place\", \"and it's my understanding that subsequent to that time around the year two thousand to two thousand and four the british government really did engage in cancer center and regionalization and that the care in breast cancer is greatly improved\", \"You live in that arena and you've witnessed that and I wonder if you would just comment because one of our themes is there is a need for some level of specialization even in breast cancer.\", 'Okay, I am going to share my thoughts with you and the participants.', \"I'm sure that I hope that I'm not offending anybody, but the story goes that when I first came to this country in 99 breast surgery was dealt with by the most clumsy surgeons. They were perhaps not very skilled for visceral surgery, so they were relegated to subcutaneous cancer surgery.\", 'And therefore, the, um, cosmetic outcomes when outcomes were unbelievable, and the, uh, oncological, uh, results were also very, very poor.', 'Y en esos días, todavía sufríamos de los egos que, ya sabes, los cirujanos pueden hacer todo, o no necesitas, te he curado, no necesitas ningún quimioterapia, no necesitas ningún radio. Simplemente vuelves a mí en seis meses, en un año, y estás curado.', 'Now, fortunately, there has been a desire, a decision to establish dedicated breast surgeons.', 'The old guys have retired and now there are more and more young people who are really focusing on breast only.', 'And this means that they are not doing the on-call in the night, they are simply focusing on breast cancer surgery.', \"And also, Professor Adagio, isn't it true that there's been an establishment of cancer centers on a regional basis that, not only for breast, but for other diseases, has elevated the quality of care?\", \"Yes, definitely so. This is particularly true for advanced cancer surgery, as you pointed out, liver surgery, pancreatic surgery, sarcomas, peritoneal disease. There is no point in having 20 units across the country. We have four accredited, fully audited and nicely scrutinized and beautifully performing units, so that's the setting.\", 'The point I was making is that I think that the young generation has now embraced, as you were saying before, the idea of working together and deciding, yes, surgical issues, but at what time, in which patients, how aggressive should we be?', 'And what is left after surgery?', 'And we are definitely improving on these, and the results are there. The cancer outcomes have improved.', \"I'm not sure that I can quote it due to the establishment of the multidisciplinary team, but it's definitely true that this cohesive philosophy, this harmonic approach to the cancer patient has definitely improved the outcomes.\", 'Yeah, and I think the teaching point, the summary of all of this talk is that surgeons have to play a role in this rapidly advancing field, and that tragically, billions of people are not getting access to safe, affordable and timely care.', 'and i think all of us need to redouble our efforts to help cancer patients throughout the world so that regardless of where they live they can gain access either by a more educated and trained local physician or referral to a regional center', 'And that the education process is enhanced in every country so that we can all keep up with this rapidly growing field and be able to safely introduce these new therapies as they are approved by governments and insurance schemes.', 'I am very grateful, Professor Bach, for your time, for your wise vision and for sharing your thoughts with us.', 'Grazie mille, grazie, ciao ciao, arrivederci, grazie.

More than two billion people have no access to surgery and anesthesia and moreover this figure is probably an underestimate.', 'So universal access to safe, affordable, surgical care is essential.', 'In a subsequent paper that Dr Audisio and I were involved in, in Lancet Oncology focused on global cancer surgery and how to deliver safe, affordable and timely cancer surgery and I would really commend this paper for all of you who are listening to read.', \"So this paper was published in Lancet Oncology in 2015 and as you can see from the arrows after Audisio and I were both co-authors of this and part of the summary which I will highlight very briefly stated that by the year 2030, that's just thirteen years from now, we estimate that forty five million surgical procedures will be needed worldwide and yet less than twenty five percent of cancer patients worldwide actually get safe affordable or timely surgery.\", \"So there's much work to be done here and just a few more quotes from this paper in Lancet Oncology that issues of access to surgery, a paucity of investment in public surgical systems, low investment in research, in training, in surgery and educational gaps are remarkably widespread globally.\", \"And we offered up solutions that include, a better regulated public system especially in the training and certification of surgeons, international partnerships, super centralization of surgical services and I'll come back to that later, novel surgical clinical trials, and new approaches to improve quality and scale-up of cancer surgical systems through education and training.\", \"And I'll give some examples of that later in this lecture.\", 'So going on with a few more summary statements from this important paper, achieving good outcomes in modern cancer surgery is technically demanding and it is recognized that outcomes improve when such surgery is undertaken by specialized teams in high volume centres.', \"And I'll go into this important strategy in more detail but with the emphasis that we're talking about the more complicated patients, the more complicated operations, and in high volume centers.\", \"But I think what's important as a summary is that access to high-quality training in these units with suitable accreditation and quality control for aspiring oncologic surgeons has yet to be formally met by regulatory authorities in actually quite a number of countries.\", 'And although high-income countries such as many countries in Europe and in the United States are driving greater specialization, globally there is a need for surgeons with much wider training the surgical professional societies must play an enhanced role in this area and finally, that high income and middle income countries have a duty and an opportunity to expand their educational offerings on cancer surgery to low income countries through bilateral exchanges, a greater use of technology enhanced learning, and partnerships to develop specific curriculum content on cancer into general surgery residency training programs.', \"These are some examples of the partnerships and availability of global programs in education including the Society of Surgical Oncology, the European Society, the British Association and several other organizations such as ESMO, ASCO, and a group that I'm involved in called Health Volunteers Overseas, that's based in the United States.\", 'In these next few slides I want to emphasize the importance and the value in terms of quality care on specialisation.', \"There's been a rapid and substantial advances in cancer research, with new diagnostics in biomarkers, new systemic therapies including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy and more recently immunotherapy.\", 'And this has led to new combinations and sequences of cancer treatments including new adjuvant, and adjuvant therapies in the surgical patients.', 'So all of us in surgery has to keep up with these rapidly advancing fields.', 'There are major advances in surgical technologies in the operating room as well, such as, laparoscopic surgery, robotic surgery and intraoperative imaging techniques. And the question is then, how can we excise cancer with better and safer results, with lower incidence of complications, and better local regional control, and the importance in in addition of rehabilitation and restoring function to patients after surgery.', 'And there are many changes now in the delivery of cancer care through the regional concept of cancer centers, a multi-disciplinary team of oncologic specialists which have to include surgeons who choose to spend part of their time as part of a multi-disciplinary team and participating in treatment planning with our colleagues in medical radiation oncology, pathology and radiology.', \"And I'll show just a few slides of evidence that high volume cancer centers and surgical specialists have better outcomes for treating complex cancers.\", 'And as I mentioned again at the end of, this does not mean for the routine operations and routine patients that need to specialize because we do need general surgeons who practice high-quality and safe surgery but has the judgment to know when some patients should be passed on to a regional centre where they could get better results.', 'And just to show you an example for a common disease, this was a publication in the British Journal of Cancer in 2004, in which I quote that breast cancer patients treated in by specialists compared to non specialist unit had half the risk of inadequate treatment of the breast and a five fold lower risk of inadequate axillary surgery and a nine times lower risk of inex inadequate axillary treatment. and that actually local recurrence rates which is a metric of surgical outcome was fifty seven percent lower at eight years and the risk of death from breast cancer was twenty percent lower for women treated in specialist units.', 'And that we conclude that adequate surgical management of breast centers is fundamental to improving the outcome for breast cancer irrespective of where it is delivered.', 'Now remember this was published in 2004 and since then the British healthcare system has really developed much greater cancer centres and regionalisation of breast cancer which perhaps Professor Audisio may want to comment on.', 'But here in the United States there were also a number of papers at the time showing that surgical volume impacts survival if surgeons perform at least fifteen or more breast cancer operations per year and that with surgical specialisation those trained in breast surgery oncology or surgical oncology there was a thirty six percent reduction in the risk of death at five years even after adjusting for hospital volume, surgical volume, age, stage and race of the patient.', \"And here are just a few examples that I selected for the New England Journal of Medicine classic studies showing the relationship between hospital volume and surgical mortality in the United States and the teaching point here is for colectomy a more standard operation there wasn't a difference comparing hospital volume and adjusted mortality however, there was a significant difference in treatment related mortality after surgery for gastrectomy a suffragette to me and pancreatic resections.\", 'Going on in another paper looking at surgeon volume the last paper was on hospital volume. Surgeon volume and operative mortality, again there were some operations such as, were looking at adjusted operative mortality there was not much different in resection for lung cancer or for cystecomy, but there was a highly significant difference comparing surgeon volume and operative mortality for esophagectomy and pancreas resections.', 'Now this is an interlude slide just to remind you that your views are important, you can ask questions and send comments by clicking on the Q & A button and sending in your questions so at the end of this lecture Professor Audisio and I can lead a discussion with your questions.', \"Getting back to my lecture I wanted to point out that volume either hospital or surgeon volume, isn't always the most important thing, that patient risk factors are important as well and I've showed some photos either from my travels in Africa or even from my own personal experience of patients who have neglected their tumors or they've had inadequate treatment at the beginning and suffer at the end with extensive regional metastasis that might have been controlled had surgery been more complete or done at an earlier time in the course of the patient's disease.\", 'So this is just illustrating that patient stage presentation and comorbidity of patients, especially among older patients, will also make a difference in outcome.', 'So in summary from some of these papers from the New England Journal of Medicine and every publication in other publications, if one is comparing the post-operative mortality in specialized centers, comparing to community hospitals in the United States there was no difference for variety of tumors involving Breast, Melanoma, Ovarian, Prostate, Thyroid and Uterine.', 'However, there were differences among high risk patients comparing the specialized centers with community hospitals, showing that for the highest risk and high risk patients, there was a significant difference in specializations whereas in patients with low risk there was not a difference between the specialized centers and the community hospitals.', 'And finally, there was a difference for all patients, for these two areas pancreas and esophagus, comparing post-operative mortality. Showing that regardless of the patients risk factors that those patients treated in specialized centers had a significant reduction in post-operative mortality for these two conditions.', 'And here is just one other paper from Dr Birkmeyer in the New England Journal of Medicine, again showing hospital mortality and both based on surgeon volume and hospital volume, showing highly significant differences of relating volume and outcome with regard to thirty day surgically related mortality.', 'The American College of Surgeons has launched on a NSQIP program a national surgical quality improvement program, for which most of the hospitals now in the United States participate in these NSQIP programs and this just shows when a program was initiated at a national level and in this case by the American College of Surgeons, that sixty six percent of the hospitals, now these are almost all the hospitals in the United States, including community hospitals, that sixty six percent of them improve their mortality, eighty two percent improve their morbidity, the worst performing that is low volume surgeons or low volume hospitals, were more likely to improve but even good performers were improved as well.', 'And that the number of low outliers increased and the number of high outliers decrease which is good based upon these quality programs initiated at a national levels.', 'And because of this program, each hospital was estimated to avoid two hundred and fifty complications per year in each hospital on the average.', 'So again I want you to send in your questions by clicking on the Q & A budget and then will resume in another area about the training of oncological surgeons.', \"And here's a very important point, although we talk about surgical oncology and super specialisation, the American Board of Surgery, which certifies all general surgeons and general surgery based specialties, include surgical oncology including head and neck surgery among its core areas that are included in its board exams.\", 'So surgical oncology and the understanding about the role of surgery in cancer management is equally important to trauma, burns, vascular, pediatrics, critical care, and other criteria.', 'And going beyond that, are two organizations, the Society of Surgical Oncology and the European Society of Surgical Oncology, led by Dr Chandra Are here in the United States, but also including Professor Audisio representing the ESSO, and published two important papers the first showing very large variations in the training of surgical oncologists around the world, and then jointly proposing a global curriculum in surgical oncology that can be used both for training general surgeons but also as curriculum recommendations for training surgical oncology specialists, who are very important at the national level for managing very complex patients and for leading the training programs of general surgeons.', 'And, our curriculum features both in the United States and in these global curriculum included the distinguishing features of surgical oncologists, who manage complex operations, who are part of a multidisciplinary team that involved medical and radiation oncology in treatment planning for patients at the outset of their diagnosis and participate as an oncologist in long term disease management of the cancer patient.', 'And, this recently the American Board of Surgery has approved a new certificate in complex general surgical oncology, acknowledging that there is a sufficient amount of specialized material that justifies a separate sub-board in complex general surgical oncology.', 'Now in a formal level and this comes along the Board certifications in medical oncology, pediatric oncology and radiation oncology there is now a separate Board in complex general surgical oncology.', 'And this two year training involves additional training in multi-disciplinary cancer care, surgical management of oncology conditions, patient counseling on cancer prevention and intervention, and very importantly, the participation and leadership in clinical research and clinical trial design.', 'And this includes such things that actually all general surgeons managing breast cancer for example and especially those surgical oncologists who specialize in breast cancer, need to know how to use ultrasound and core needle biopsy.', 'And I say this because in my travels to other countries there are still many community based centers ,were doing an open biopsy, as to make the diagnosis of breast cancer is the standard of care.', 'Whereas, in the specialty hospitals and in many centres in Europe and in the United States, even at the community level, the standard of care is to use a core needle biopsy instead of an open biopsy, as the preferred treatment for patients with a first diagnosis of breast cancer.', 'Now in these next few slides, I want to emphasize what is a very important part of the surgical patients here in breast cancer in patients who present with stage three disease, that with contemporary chemotherapy and systemic and targeted therapy, patients are now achieving a pathological complete response in forty to sixty percent of such patients, and this is going to change how we manage patients surgically because surgery may not be the first modality of treatment.', 'Here in breast cancer in the United States the majority of breast cancer patients with stage two and stage three breast cancer and I think in many centers in Europe especially for stage three disease, they had systemic therapy is the first treatment and then surgery is the second treatment, so there are many different planning that we have to do with our colleagues in medical oncology about the timing of surgery, the role of the sentinel node which is different in this setting, but this does represent the future of our treatments for many diseases for which breast cancer is the prototype that will change.', \"But here's another example, here is a patient with both bulky and unresectable advanced melanoma in the groin and pelvis, who was treated with immunotherapy and after immunotherapy had such a shrinkage that it facilitated the operation, and in fact in this patient when all these masses were removed they were all containing chronic inflammation and scar. This patient had a pathological complete response which could not have been stage without surgical resection of the tumor masses that originally were detected.\", 'So the future of cancer systemic therapy is changing dramatically, there are more effective therapies and in fact many of the new therapies are going to be oral therapies that are much less toxicity and will impact in the surgical patient.', 'Here is just an example of where new oral or subcutaneous agents are available for a variety of cancer types.', 'Just to give you some examples, these are the more dramatic examples, but they are getting to be more typical.', 'This is a patient who had extensive metastatic melanoma that even after two weeks of therapy you can see the PET/CT scan showed dramatic reductions in this extensive tumor.', 'And these agents are so powerful, they are already beginning to be applied in stage three melanoma patients.', 'The other major advance that is happening is the use of immunotherapy with the new checkpoint inhibitors, which now have activity in over seventeen different types of cancer, and this does represent our future that will be used increasingly in surgical patients.', 'But just to give you a few individual examples so that you have some idea about the future of therapy, here is an example of a very large melanoma metastasis, that after a single dose of combination immunotherapy this patient had a pathological complete response, demonstrated by surgical excision of the remaining tissue.', \"And here's maybe a more famous example, our US President Jimmy Carter, this is in the public arena, presented with liver and brain metastasis. and at age ninety two was treated for a short interval with a single dose of a anti pd1 checkpoint inhibitor.\", 'He has now been disease free and in complete remission for over fourteen months, with this single agent in a patient who is much older and tolerated this treatment.', 'I wanted to show yet another example of a patient with head & neck cancer that was ninety six, extensive disease and even after four weeks with this anti pd1 single therapy had a dramatic response.', \"So if we're seeing these kind of treatment responses in patients with more advanced disease, you can be sure that this will migrate into the treatment of patients with earlier disease, such as stage two and stage three cancers.\", 'So how are we as practicing surgeons going to keep up with these rapidly advancing fields, both fields in systemic therapy, radiation therapy and either in also technological advances in the operating room and new advances in biomarkers used to select patients for these different treatments.', 'And here again, there are a whole variety of ways that this is happening, with live meetings, especially those conducted by the SSO and the ESSO and BASO. But also through affiliations with the tertiary centers such as in my institution, with community hospitals, with advances in journals, with email collaborations or with live webinars, such as this webinars that is being conducted by the European Institute of Oncology.', 'Both Dr Audisio and I, are the editors-in-chief of our two respected journals and we would commend those to you, for keeping up with the field, both the online version and the print version.', 'The Society of Surgical Oncology also now has a self assessment program, that is conducted to help surgeons keep up with the field in oncology.', \"And, increasingly we're using telemedicine in the United States, that is increasingly being integrated into the ongoing operations of hospital specialty departments, home health agencies, private physician offices, and in some cases even for educational purposes in the consumer's home.\", 'So telemedicine is increasingly being used not only in the United States but around the world, both for medical education to physicians, especially those in the community setting and those in more rural areas, and also for specialist consultative services, especially in helping in patient care decision making, in other locations or even in other nations.', 'The technology allows us now to, with high resolution, to view images of x- rays, images of pathology, and even to do, to look at ultrasound images real time, that are being conducted in another site and transmitted electronically to a central site by telemedicine.', \"I've even been involved in a company called Cancer Expert Now, I'm the president of Cancer Expert Now International, where we do consultation with physicians.\", 'This shows an example by telemedicine, of one of our neuro oncologists doing a consultation with a physician in another country on a complicated patient with a brain tumor.', 'And, this shows just another example where I was in Huangshan, China. And we conducted a telemedicine virtual tumor board, here with Dr Hope Rugo, who was in San Francisco at the time, discussing a complicated patient with breast cancer.', 'And here is, right after this, a televideo at this, in the same location, on a complex colon cancer patient with Dr Glen Balch who is chief of colorectal surgery at Emory in Atlanta.', 'Again just showing the illustrations about how virtual tumor boards can be used to help in the advice and recommendations for patients with complex cancer, now anywhere in the world.', 'And I just included this slide, for an abstract that was presented last year at ASCO, showing that ninety one percent of virtual tumor board attendees found it to be very helpful, and one hundred percent of the attendees felt that the quality of care was improved.', \"Alright and then again we're almost finishing our talk, I'm going to do the summary shortly.\", 'And just as a reminder to do your Q & A buttons as I summarize.', 'So how do we as surgeons adapt to a change in a rapidly changing cancer patients?', 'It is clear in the United States and I think in many parts of Europe and elsewhere in the world, that many cancer patients will receive more than one modality of treatment. And that contemporary cancer care is a team approach, combining the collective wisdom of surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and other times with their pathology and radiation oncology.', 'It is clear with the advances in effective systemic therapy, that cancer is becoming a chronic or curable disease.', 'Breast cancer is a very good example of that.', 'And after all of these intensive treatments, survivorships in patients who are living for years after their treatment, are at risk for second primarys, treatment compliance, and the consequences of their intensive multi-disciplinary treatment.', 'The oncology field is one of the most rapidly advancing and changing specialities in all of medicine, and that means that we as surgeons have to keep up through continuing education and incorporate these changes into the curriculum of our trainees.', \"And it's also important to validate these advances in surgical patients systematically through clinical trials.\", \"And as I've tried to emphasize there is a continuing partnerships of professional organizations, especially in the United States, in Europe, on physician continuing education, that has to occur for lifetime. And in improving the curriculum of general surgeons and general surgery based specialities in all, all institutions throughout the world.\", 'Surgeons in order to achieve a better outcome, are going to need to partition their patients and identify those, for which specialisation or referral to high volume centres specializing in certain diseases, will have a better outcome for treating patients with complex or advanced cancers.', \"And there's both a public and even a government demand for getting optimal care from specialists, multi-disciplinary cancer centres, and regionalization of cancer therapy.\", \"However, it's important to emphasize, this does not mean that all cancer patients need to be treated by specialists, especially if there's a diagnosis that's made early and the treatment is standard and does not need multiple specialties for their care.\", 'We really believe that patients should stay in their local environment, as much as possible, and this is where things like telemedicine may have a role in helping ensure that patients, even in a smaller community hospital, are getting advice and treatment planning, with input from specialists through telemedicine or consultation.', 'And, that those of us who specialize as surgical oncologist, should be educational and research leaders among the general surgery community.', \"Now I'm almost finished with my talk, in the summary the professional societies, such as the society I represent, the Society of Surgical Oncology and previously I was CEO of ASCO, the european SSO, the American College of Surgeons, ASCO, are examples of organizations that can be important components of defining the standards for treating surgical patients with cancer and providing education, training, workshops to help other surgeons achieve optimal cancer care.\", 'And, that the partnerships across their professional societies, which is well developed between the Europeans in American SSO organizations, will advance our specialty and improve the care for our patients.', 'So that is my conclusion, I will now turn this over to Professor Audisio for his comments and to answer any questions that you may have made during this discussion.', 'Thank you very much.', 'Thank you Charles, we have no words to be grateful to Professor Balch for summarizing the present and the future of good quality cancer surgery worldwide.', 'And I really mean worldwide because this is not just the sophisticated, super advanced, surgical procedure that you might expect from an advanced tertiary referral center, this is a philosophy, this is a very basic attitude, that we should all embrace even in a district general hospital, there is room and there is need for some kind of surgeons, who is aware of the multi-disciplinarity of the oncological practice, and he was keener to talk to different specialties, then offer his own his/her own patients, the most appropriate treatment.', \"So am I right to say, Professor Balch, that the bring home message is that good quality cancer surgery is expected, is demanded and it's a worldwide need not just from top cancer units, but from most, from actually all district hospitals as well?\", \"That's absolutely true and I think the professional organizations and governments in each nation, need to insist that their citizens get high quality care and ensure, in each nation, that there are well trained surgeons, that there are organizational systems, such as regional cancer centers, and I think increasingly that there are relationships internationally with individuals or with organizations, medical centers and cancer centers, that can be of assistance for consultation in complex patients, and in education of the surgeons in the local communities and even in the more provincial or national cancer centers in hospitals.\", \"For example, next weeky, that I'm doing a multi-disciplinary tumor board with a provincial hospital in China, and part of our theme is going to be, how we can increase our use of televideo in order to increase access for the doctors in China with experts to help in the intellectual decision making for complex cancer patients.\", 'I think this is a very hot topic and perhaps we want to spend a little bit more time on how best to facilitate these.', \"We've just, you've just point out how the network is there, and I would encourage young surgeons in training to feel absolutely free to follow their dreams, study their topics, and when they meet the big professor at the meeting the pull the sleeve and, and, contact specialist, top specialists, then feel free to communicate with them, perhaps engage with them in the discussion and feel comfortable enough to take advantage of the large network that is available through the SSO, the American Society of Surgical Oncology, and the European one as well, we're at the moment working on facilitating these for developing countries in Africa, through the unrestricted grant that pharmaceutical companies are making available ,this is in my mind, the way forward.\", 'So I encourage you guys to come and talk to Professor Balch, to myself, and to whoever you want to improve your knowledge.', \"I think the important point is we can't mandate these changes, the initiative has to come from the surgeon in the each community, from their hospital, and from their government, both their local government and their national government, to raise the level of expectations for high quality and timely care.\", 'And then work in each nation within the limitations of their resources, in order to achieve that over time.', \"Shall we also say words in warning, some easy bite on super advanced technicalities. i.e. You don't want a PET scan, when you don't have a ultrasound machine.\", \"You might consider not purchasing a robotic equipment, when you're missing a basic laparoscopic stuff, and therefore you need to develop the system, as you're saying, step by step according to the local facilities at a regional or provincial level.\", \"Yes it's absolutely true, I've been in one major hospital in Africa which has a very expensive radiation therapy machine that is still in boxes because they don't have the radiation physicists or the radiation technicians for the service component, but they have the machine in a box, that somebody bought, but it's more than that.\", 'So it takes planning at the government level and at the hospital level, to make sure to define, not just the capital expenditures of buildings and equipment but the delivery of the services by qualified and trained individuals, at all levels.', \"So, Professor Balch, we always have enemies and allies, when we want to achieve a target, and that's a bit of a silly and restrictive way to look at it. But it has been the case that most surgical oncologists would blame the general surgeons for not embracing an oncological attitude or philosophy and on the other hand, some medical oncologists are wiping surgeons skills under the carpet.\", 'Are we right to say that we actually need everyone and we welcome everyone on board, because this is an ongoing discussion which is just a pleasure to create together as it develops.', 'I agree, and I think the point here is that the surgeon has to be involved in the treatment planning.', \"As you and I have talked about there are other specialties and surgeons who spend all their time in the operating room, and allowed the internal medicine trained person to get at the front and make all the decisions and now in that specialty and I'm talking about cardiac surgery, the surgeon is the court of last resort, after all medical treatments have failed.\", \"And my concern that if the surgeon doesn't bring the surgical perspective to the treatment planning, and is engaged with the medical oncologist and radiation oncologist, the patients may not get the full advantage of a true multi-disciplinary treatment approach that does involve surgery, but we are best trained and have the experience to determine what's the best timing of surgery in some combination and sequence.\", 'If we are not at the table, we will be the court of last resort after all else fails with medical treatment and radiation treatment.', 'So we have to be engaged in the treatment planning at the outset.', \"Yeah good so once again we totally embrace a multi-disciplinary attitude, where more and more perhaps new figures are taking part for example, I'm thinking of interventional radiologists that only maybe a decade or two decades ago were almost unknown but nowadays there's this stent strictures, they put catheters, they deliver medication and isotopes, and so once again let's straightly reiterate the point that, we want everyone on board here.\", \"I'm taking advantage of the time because I understand from the organizer that there is a problem with the questions coming in and this has not been made available today, there is a technical hiccup.\", \"So we do apologise for this and let's make sure that if you have any question you definitely can come back, the audience can definitely come back to me and Professor Balch in writing and we will be pleased to provide any, any answer or satisfy any request.\", \"But I'm very pleased to be part of this important session and to join you, an internationally renowned surgical oncologist, in this educational forum by televideo.\", \"I'm also very grateful to the European School of Oncology, cause we often feel that the surgical team is a bit neglected so, I'd like to congratulate ESO for this and perhaps you know, twist their arm and make sure that more space and more interest is devolved towards what surgeons are doing.\", 'Is there any conclusive note that you would like to underline Professor Balch?', \"Yes, I'd like you to get the last word, I purposely planted the slides about breast cancer management in Great Britain, a high income place.\", \"And it's my understanding that subsequent to that time around the year 2002-2004, the British government really did engage in cancer center, in regionalization and that the care in breast cancer has greatly improved.\", \"You live in that arena and you've witnessed that, now wonder if you would just comment because one of our themes is there is a need for some level of specialisation, even in breast cancer.\", \"Okay, I'm gonna share my thoughts with you and the participants.\", \"I'm sure that, I hope that I'm not offending anybody, but the story goes that, when I first came to this country in 99, breast surgery was dealt with by the most clumsy surgeons, they were perhaps not very skilled for a visceral surgery, so they were relegated to a subcutaneous cancer surgeon.\", 'And therefore, the cosmetic outcomes were unbelievable, and the oncological results were also very, very poor.', \"And those days, we were still suffering of the egos, that you know surgeons can do everything, or you don't need, I've cured you, you don't need any chemo, you don't need any radio, you just come back to me in six months, in one year and you're sorted.\", 'Now, fortunately, there has been a desire, a decision to establish dedicated breast surgeons.', 'The old guys have retired and now there are more and more young people who are really focusing on breast only.', 'And this means that they are not doing the on call in the night, they are simply focusing on breast cancer surgery.', \"Also Professor Audisio, isn't it true that there's been an establishment of cancer centers, on a regional basis that, not only for breast but for other diseases, has elevated the quality of care.\", \"Yes definitely so, this is particularly true for advanced cancer surgery, as you pointed out, liver surgery, pancreatic surgery, sarcomas, peritoneal disease, there is no point in having twenty units across the country, we have four accredited fully audited, and nicely scrutinised and beautifully performing unit, so that's that's the setting.\", 'But the point i was making is that, I think the young generation is now embraced, as you were saying before, the idea of working together and deciding yes surgical issues but at what time? in which patients? how aggressive should we be?', 'And, and what is left after surgery?', 'And, we are definitely improving on this and the results are there, the cancer outcomes have improved.', \"I'm not sure that I can quote it due to the, this the establishment of the multi-disciplinary team, but it's definitely true that this cohesive philosophy, this harmonic approach to the cancer patients has definitely milliard improved the the outcomes.\", 'Yeah, and I think the teaching point the summary of all of this talk is that, surgeons have to play a role in this rapidly advancing field and that tragically billions of people are not getting access to safe, affordable and timely care.', 'And I think all of us need to redouble our efforts to help cancer patients throughout the world, so that regardless of where they live, they can gain access, either by a more educated and trained local physician, or referral to a regional centre.', 'And that the education process, is enhanced in every country so that we can all keep up with this rapidly growing field and be able to safely introduce these new therapies, as they are approved by governments and insurance schemes.', 'I am very grateful Professor Balch for your time, for your wise vision, and for sharing your thoughts with us.', 'I just want to say you grazie molte, grazie, ciao ciao, arrivederci, grazie Thank you Professor Balch and thank you Professor Audisio.', 'Ladies and gentlemen the session has now concluded.', 'If interested in CME accreditation,

Quirúrgica y el presidente electo de la Sociedad Europea de Oncología Quirúrgica y él moderará una ronda de preguntas y respuestas al final de mi presentación.', 'Así que voy a exponer brevemente mis diapositivas, pero espero que más adelante descarguen varios artículos que creo que son documentos fundamentales que involucran cirujanos de todo el mundo, y que provienen de la Comisión Lancet que se publicaron en 2015 en Lancet Oncology.', 'El primero de ellos fue sobre cirugía global en el año 2030 y voy a leer unas citas de estos artículos.', 'La primera es que el acceso a la atención quirúrgica es esencial para reducir la mortalidad y morbilidad por afecciones quirúrgicas, sin embargo y esto es realmente un hecho importante y alarmante.Más de 2000 millones de personas no tienen acceso a la cirugía y la anestesia y, además, esta cifra está probablemente subestimada.', 'Por lo tanto, el acceso universal a una atención quirúrgica segura y asequible es fundamental.', 'En un artículo posterior en el que participamos el Dr. Audisio y yo, en Lancet Oncology, nos centramos en la cirugía oncológica global y en cómo administrar una cirugía oncológica segura, asequible y oportuna y realmente yo recomendaría que todos los que nos están escuchando lo leyeran.', 'Bueno, este artículo fue publicado en Lancet Oncology en 2015 y como pueden ver en las flechas el Dr. Audisio y yo fuimos sus coautores y parte del resumen que voy a destacar muy brevemente indicaba que para el año 2030, para lo que solo faltan trece años, calculamos que serán necesarios 45 millones de procedimientos quirúrgicos en todo el mundo y sin embargo menos del 25% de los pacientes de cáncer en todo el mundo realmente consiguen una cirugía segura, asequible u oportuna.', 'Así que queda mucho trabajo por hacer a este respecto y citaré algunas cosas más de este artículo en Lancet Oncology; que los problemas del acceso a la cirugía, la escasez de inversión en sistemas quirúrgicos públicos, la baja inversión en investigación, en formación, en cirugía y las brechas en formación están notablemente extendidas en todo el mundo.', 'Y hemos ofrecido soluciones que incluyen, un sistema público mejor regulado, especialmente en la formación y la certificación de cirujanos, colaboraciones internacionales, súper centralización de los servicios quirúrgicos y, volveré a hablar de esto más tarde, nuevos ensayos clínicos quirúrgicos, y nuevos enfoques para mejorar la calidad y el escalamiento de los sistemas de cirugía oncológica cáncer a través de la formación y la capacitación.', 'Les daré algunos ejemplos más adelante en esta conferencia.', 'Continuando con algunas declaraciones más resumidas de este importante artículo, lograr buenos resultados en la cirugía oncológica moderna es algo técnicamente exigente y es sabido que los resultados mejoran cuando dicha cirugía es realizada por equipos especializados en centros de alto volumen.', 'Y voy a entrar en esta importante estrategia con más detalle, pero haciendo hincapié en que estamos hablando de los pacientes más complicados, las operaciones más complicadas, y en centros de alto volumen.', 'Pero creo que lo que es importante como resumen es que el acceso a la formación de alta calidad en estas unidades, con la acreditación y el control de calidad adecuados para los aspirantes a cirujanos oncológicos, todavía tiene que ser cumplido formalmente por parte de las autoridades regulatorias en un número considerable de países.', 'Y aunque los países con niveles de renta altos como muchos países de Europa y Estados Unidos están impulsando una mayor especialización, a nivel mundial se necesitan cirujanos con una formación mucho más amplia; las asociaciones profesionales quirúrgicas deben desempeñar un papel más importante en esta área y, por último, que los países con niveles de renta altos y medios tienen el deber y la oportunidad de ampliar sus ofertas formativas de cirugía oncológica a países con niveles de renta bajos a través de intercambios bilaterales, de un mayor uso de la formación reforzada por la tecnología y colaboraciones para desarrollar contenidos curriculares específicos sobre el cáncer dentro de programas de formación de residentes de cirugía general.', 'Estos son solo algunos ejemplos de las asociaciones y la disponibilidad de programas globales de formación, como la Sociedad de Oncología Quirúrgica, la Sociedad Europea, la Asociación Británica y otras muchas organizaciones como la ESMO, la ASCO, y un grupo en el que participo llamado Health Volunteers Overseas, con sede en los Estados Unidos.', 'En las siguientes diapositivas quiero destacar la importancia y el valor de la especialización en términos de calidad de la atención.', 'Ha habido avances rápidos y sustanciales en la investigación del cáncer, con nuevos diagnósticos mediante biomarcadores, nuevas terapias sistémicas que incluyen quimioterapia, terapia hormonal, terapia dirigida y, más recientemente, inmunoterapia.', 'Y esto ha dado lugar a nuevas combinaciones y secuencias de tratamientos contra el cáncer, incluidos tratamientos neoadyuvantes y adyuvantes en los pacientes quirúrgicos.', 'Así que todos los que nos dedicamos a la cirugía tenemos que estar al día en los rápidos avances de estos campos.', 'También se están produciendo grandes avances en las tecnologías quirúrgicas en el quirófano, como la cirugía laparoscópica, la cirugía robótica y las técnicas de imagen intraoperatorias.Y entonces, la pregunta es, cómo podemos extirpar el cáncer con mejores resultados y más seguros, con menor incidencia de complicaciones y mejor control local regional, y la importancia, además de la rehabilitación y el restablecimiento de la función de los pacientes después de la cirugía.', 'Y ahora hay muchos cambios en la forma de administrar atención oncológica a través del concepto regional de centros oncológicos, un equipo multidisciplinario de especialistas oncológicos que tiene que incluir cirujanos que deciden pasar parte de su tiempo como miembros de un equipo multidisciplinario y participar en la planificación del tratamiento con nuestros colegas en radiooncología médica, patología y radiología.', 'Y les mostraré algunas diapositivas que demuestran que los centros oncológicos de alto volumen y los especialistas quirúrgicos obtienen mejores resultados al tratar cánceres complejos.', 'Y como ya he dicho, en el fondo esto no significa que para las operaciones de rutina y los pacientes de rutina sea necesario especializarse porque necesitamos cirujanos generales que practiquen cirugía de alta calidad y segura, pero que tengan el criterio necesario para saber cuándo algunos pacientes deben ser transferidos a un centro regional donde podrían obtener mejores resultados.', 'Y sólo para mostrarles un ejemplo de una enfermedad frecuente, me referiré a una publicación en el British Journal of Cancer en 2004, en la que comento que las pacientes con cáncer de mama tratadas por especialistas en comparación con una unidad no especializada tenían la mitad de riesgo de recibir un tratamiento inadecuado de la mama y un riesgo cinco veces menor de someterse a una cirugía axilar inadecuada y un riesgo nueve veces menor de recibir un tratamiento axilar inadecuado; y que las tasas de recurrencia locales, que es una medida del resultado quirúrgico, era un 57% menor a los ocho años y el riesgo de muerte por cáncer de mama era un 20% menor en las mujeres tratadas en unidades especializadas.', 'Y que concluimos que el manejo quirúrgico adecuado de los centros de la mama es fundamental para mejorar el desenlace del cáncer de mama, independientemente de dónde se haga.', 'Recuerden que esto se publicó en 2004 y desde entonces el sistema sanitario británico ha desarrollado centros oncológicos mucho más grandes y una regionalización del cáncer de mama sobre la que quizá el profesor Audisio quiera comentar.', 'Pero aquí en los Estados Unidos también hubo varios artículos en ese momento que mostraban que el volumen quirúrgico afecta la supervivencia si los cirujanos realizan al menos quince o más operaciones de cáncer de mama al año y que con la especialización quirúrgica (aquellos entrenados en cirugía oncológica de la mama u oncología quirúrgica) hubo una reducción del 36% en el riesgo de muerte a los cinco años incluso después de ajustar según el volumen hospitalario, el volumen quirúrgico, la edad, el estadio y la raza de la paciente.', 'Y he aquí algunos ejemplos que he seleccionado para el New England Journal of Medicine —estudios clásicos que muestran la relación entre el volumen hospitalario y la mortalidad quirúrgica en los Estados Unidos y nos muestra que para la colectomía, una operación más estándar, no hubo una diferencia comparando el volumen hospitalario y la mortalidad ajustada sin embargo, hubo una diferencia significativa en la mortalidad relacionada con el tratamiento después de la cirugía en el caso de la gastrectomía, esofagectomía y resecciones pancreáticas.', 'Continuando, en otro artículo que analiza el volumen del cirujano, el último artículo se centraba en el volumen del hospital.El volumen del cirujano y la mortalidad quirúrgica, de nuevo hubo algunas operaciones como, atendiendo a la mortalidad quirúrgica ajustada, no hubo mucha diferencia en la resección en casos de cáncer de pulmón o la cistectomía, pero hubo una diferencia muy significativa al comparar el volumen del cirujano y la mortalidad quirúrgica en la esofagectomía y las resecciones pancreáticas.', 'Esta diapositiva es un paréntesis, sólo para recordarles que sus opiniones son importantes, pueden hacer preguntas y enviar comentarios haciendo clic en el botón Preguntas y respuestas y enviando sus preguntas para que al final de esta conferencia el profesor Audisio y yo podamos moderar un debate con sus preguntas.', 'Volviendo a mi ponencia, quería señalar que el volumen del hospital o del cirujano no siempre es lo más importante, que los factores de riesgo del paciente también son importantes y he mostrado algunas fotos de mis viajes a África o incluso de mi propia experiencia personal de pacientes que han descuidado sus tumores o que han recibido un tratamiento inadecuado al principio y sufren al final metástasis regionales extensas que podrían haberse controlado si la cirugía hubiera sido más completa o se hubiera realizado en un momento anterior en el curso de la enfermedad del paciente.', 'Esto sirve para mostrar que el estadio clínico y la comorbilidad de los pacientes, especialmente entre los pacientes de edad avanzada, también marcarán una diferencia en el resultado.', 'Así que como resumen de algunos de estos artículos del New England Journal of Medicine y de todas las publicaciones de otras publicaciones, si se compara la mortalidad postoperatoria en centros especializados, en comparación con los hospitales locales de los Estados Unidos, no hubo diferencia en diversos tumores que afectan a la mama, melanoma, ovario, próstata, tiroides y útero.', 'Sin embargo, se encontraron diferencias entre los pacientes de alto riesgo al comparar los centros especializados con los hospitales locales, lo que muestra que para los pacientes de máximo y alto riesgo hubo una diferencia significativa en las especializaciones, mientras que en los pacientes de bajo riesgo no hubo diferencia entre los centros especializados y los hospitales locales.', 'Y por último, hubo una diferencia en todos los pacientes, en estas dos áreas, páncreas y esófago, al comparar la mortalidad postoperatoriaLo que demuestra que independientemente de los factores de riesgo de los pacientes, los pacientes tratados en centros especializados presentaron una reducción significativa en la mortalidad postoperatoria en estas dos afecciones.', 'Y he aquí otro artículo del Dr. Birkmeyer en el New England Journal of Medicine, que muestra de nuevo la mortalidad hospitalaria, basada tanto en el volumen del cirujano como en el volumen hospitalario, que muestra diferencias muy significativas al relacionar volumen y resultado con respecto a la mortalidad relacionada con la cirugía a los 30 días.', 'El Colegio Estadounidense de Cirujanos ha lanzado en un programa NSQIP un programa nacional de mejora de la calidad quirúrgica, para el cual la mayoría de los hospitales de los Estados Unidos participan en estos programas NSQIP y aquí solo se muestra cuando un programa fue iniciado a nivel nacional y en este caso por el Colegio Estadounidense de Cirujanos, que el 66% de los hospitales, ahora estos son casi todos los hospitales de los Estados Unidos, incluidos los hospitales locales, que el 66% de ellos mejora la mortalidad, el 82% mejora la morbilidad, los peores resultados, es decir, los cirujanos de bajo volumen u hospitales de bajo volumen, tenían más probabilidades de mejorar, pero incluso los que tenían buenos resultados también mejoraron.', 'Y que el número de valores atípicos bajos aumentó y el número de valores atípicos altos disminuyó, lo cual es bueno tomando como base estos programas de calidad iniciados a nivel nacional.', 'Y gracias a este programa, se estimó que cada hospital evitaba 250 complicaciones por año en cada hospital en promedio.', 'De nuevo, quiero que envíen sus preguntas haciendo clic en el botón de Preguntas y respuestas y luego continuaremos en otra área sobre la formación de cirujanos oncológicos.', 'Y aquí hay un punto muy importante, aunque hablamos de oncología quirúrgica y súper especialización, la Junta Americana de Cirugía, que certifica a todos los cirujanos generales y especialidades basadas en cirugía general, incluye la oncología quirúrgica incluyendo la cirugía de cabeza y cuello entre las áreas centrales que se incluyen en sus exámenes de certificación.', 'Por lo tanto, la oncología quirúrgica y el conocimiento del papel de la cirugía en el manejo del cáncer son igualmente importantes para las quemaduras traumáticas, la pediatría vascular, la medicina intensiva y otros criterios.', 'Y yendo más allá, hay dos organizaciones, la Sociedad de Oncología Quirúrgica y la Sociedad Europea de Oncología Quirúrgica, dirigida por el Dr. Chandra Are, aquí en los Estados Unidos, pero incluyendo también al profesor Audisio representando a la ESSO, que publicaron dos importantes artículos el primero mostraba grandes variaciones en la formación de oncólogos quirúrgicos en todo el mundo, y luego proponiendo conjuntamente un plan de estudios global en oncología quirúrgica que puede ser utilizado tanto para la formación de cirujanos generales, como también como recomendaciones curriculares para la formación de especialistas en oncología quirúrgica, que son muy importantes a nivel nacional para el manejo de pacientes muy complejos y para dirigir los programas de formación de cirujanos generales.', 'Y nuestras características curriculares, tanto en los Estados Unidos como en este plan de estudios global, incluyó las características distintivas de los oncólogos quirúrgicos, que abordan operaciones complejas, que forman parte de un equipo multidisciplinario que involucraba la oncología médica y radioterápica en la planificación del tratamiento de los pacientes desde el inicio de su diagnóstico y que participan como oncólogos en el manejo a largo plazo del paciente con cáncer.', 'Y, recientemente, la Junta Americana de Cirugía ha aprobado un nuevo certificado en oncología quirúrgica general compleja, reconociendo que hay una cantidad suficiente de material especializado que justifica una subcertificación independiente en oncología quirúrgica general compleja.', 'Ahora, en un nivel formal, y esto se une a las certificaciones de la Junta en Oncología Médica, Oncología Pediátrica y Oncología Radioterápica, ahora hay una Junta separada para oncología quirúrgica general compleja.', 'Y esta formación de dos años implica una formación adicional en atención multidisciplinaria del cáncer, manejo quirúrgico de enfermedades oncológicas, asesoramiento del paciente sobre prevención e intervención del cáncer y, muy importante, la participación y el liderazgo en investigación clínica y diseño de ensayos clínicos.', 'Y esto incluye cosas que realmente todos los cirujanos generales que tratan el cáncer de mama, por ejemplo y especialmente los oncólogos quirúrgicos que se especializan en cáncer de mama, necesitan saber, cómo usar la ecografía y la biopsia con aguja gruesa.', 'Y digo esto porque en mis viajes a otros países todavía hay muchos centros locales en los que hacer una biopsia abierta, para hacer el diagnóstico del cáncer de mama es el procedimiento habitual.', 'Mientras que en los hospitales especializados y en muchos centros de Europa y Estados Unidos, incluso a nivel local, el procedimiento de referencia consiste en utilizar una biopsia con aguja gruesa en lugar de una biopsia abierta, como tratamiento de elección para las pacientes con un primer diagnóstico de cáncer de mama.', 'Ahora en las siguientes diapositivas, quiero enfatizar lo que es una parte muy importante de las pacientes quirúrgicas, aquí en el cáncer de mama en pacientes que presentan enfermedad en estadio tres, que con quimioterapia simultánea y terapia sistémica y dirigida, las pacientes están logrando una respuesta patológica completa en el 40% al 60% de estas pacientes, y esto va a cambiar la forma de tratar a las pacientes quirúrgicamente porque la cirugía puede no ser la primera modalidad de tratamiento.', 'Aquí, en el cáncer de mama en los Estados Unidos, la mayoría de las pacientes con cáncer de mama en estadio dos y estadio tres y creo que en muchos centros de Europa, especialmente para el estadio tres, la terapia sistémica es el primer tratamiento y luego la cirugía es el segundo tratamiento, así que hay muchas planificaciones diferentes que tenemos que hacer con nuestros colegas de oncología médica con respecto al momento de la cirugía, el papel del ganglio centinela que es diferente en este contexto; pero esto representa el futuro de nuestros tratamientos para muchas enfermedades para las que el cáncer de mama es el prototipo que cambiará.', 'Pero aquí hay otro ejemplo, un paciente con melanoma avanzado con gran masa tumoral e irresecable en la ingle y la pelvis, que fue tratado con inmunoterapia y después de la inmunoterapia tuvo una reducción tal que facilitó la operación, y de hecho en este paciente, cuando se extrajeron todas estas masas (todas contenían inflamación crónica y cicatriz), este paciente tuvo una respuesta patológica completa que no se habría podido lograr sin la resección quirúrgica de las masas tumorales que originalmente se detectaron.', 'Así que el futuro de la terapia sistémica para el cáncer está cambiando drásticamente, hay terapias más efectivas y de hecho muchas de las nuevas terapias van a ser terapias orales que son mucho menos tóxicas y van a repercutir en el paciente quirúrgico.', 'A continuación se presenta un ejemplo de los nuevos fármacos orales o subcutáneos disponibles para diversos tipos de cáncer.', 'Solo para darles algunos ejemplos, estos son los ejemplos más drásticos, pero se están volviendo más típicos.', 'Se trata de un paciente que tenía un melanoma metastásico extenso que incluso después de dos semanas de tratamiento se puede ver que la PET/TAC mostró reducciones drásticas de este tumor extenso.', 'Y estos agentes son tan potentes que ya se están empezando a aplicar en pacientes con melanoma en estadio tres.', 'El otro gran avance que está ocurriendo es el uso de inmunoterapia con los nuevos inhibidores de los puntos de control, que ahora actúan en más de 17 tipos diferentes de cáncer, y esto representa nuestro futuro que se utilizará cada vez más en pacientes quirúrgicos.', 'Pero sólo para darles algunos ejemplos individuales para que tengan una idea del futuro de la terapia, he aquí un ejemplo de una metástasis de melanoma muy grande, que después de una dosis única de inmunoterapia combinada este paciente tuvo una respuesta patológica completa, demostrada por la resección quirúrgica del tejido restante.', 'Y este es quizás un ejemplo más famoso, nuestro presidente estadounidense Jimmy Carter, esto es en la esfera pública, que presentó metástasis hepáticas y cerebrales. Y a los 92 años fue tratado durante un corto intervalo con una dosis única de un inhibidor del punto de control anti pd1.', 'Ahora lleva libre de la enfermedad y en remisión completa durante más de catorce meses, con este agente único en un paciente que es muy mayor y toleró este tratamiento.', 'Quería mostrar otro ejemplo más de un paciente con cáncer de cabeza y cuello que tenía 96 años, enfermedad extensa e incluso después de cuatro semanas con esta terapia anti pd1 única tuvo una respuesta drástica.', 'Así que, si vemos este tipo de respuestas al tratamiento en pacientes con enfermedad más avanzada, pueden estar seguros de que esto se llevará al tratamiento de pacientes con enfermedad más incipiente, como el cáncer en estadio dos y estadio tres.', 'Entonces, como cirujanos en ejercicio, ¿cómo vamos a mantenernos al día en estos campos de rápido avance, tanto en terapia sistémica, radioterapia como en los avances tecnológicos en el quirófano y los nuevos avances en los biomarcadores utilizados para seleccionar pacientes para estos diferentes tratamientos?', 'Y aquí, una vez más, esto está sucediendo de formas muy variadas, con reuniones en vivo, especialmente las realizadas por la SSO y la ESSO y BASO, pero también a través de afiliaciones con centros de atención especializada como en mi institución, con hospitales locales, con avances en revistas, con colaboraciones por correo electrónico o con seminarios web en vivo, como este seminario web que está llevando a cabo el Instituto Europeo de Oncología.', 'El Dr. Audisio y yo somos los redactores jefe de nuestras dos respetadas revistas y se las recomendamos, para mantenerse al día en este campo, tanto en la versión en línea como en la versión impresa.', 'La Sociedad de Oncología Quirúrgica también tiene ahora un programa de autoevaluación, que se lleva a cabo para ayudar a los cirujanos a mantenerse al día en el campo de la oncología.', 'Y en los Estados Unidos usamos cada vez más la telemedicina, que se integra cada vez más en las operaciones en curso de los departamentos de especialidades de hospitales, agencias de salud domiciliaria, consultorios médicos privados, y en algunos casos incluso con fines educativos en el hogar del consumidor.', 'Así, la telemedicina se usa cada vez más no sólo en Estados Unidos sino en todo el mundo, tanto para la formación médica de los médicos, especialmente de los de centros locales y de las zonas más rurales, como para los servicios de consulta especializada, sobre todo para ayudar en la toma de decisiones de atención por parte del paciente, en otros lugares o incluso en otros países.', 'La tecnología nos permite ahora ver con alta resolución imágenes de radiografías, imágenes de patología, e incluso hacerlo, ver en tiempo real imágenes de ecografía, que se están llevando a cabo en otro sitio y se están transmitiendo electrónicamente a un sitio central mediante telemedicina.', 'Incluso he participado en una compañía llamada Cancer Expert Now, soy el Presidente de Cancer Expert Now International, donde hacemos interconsultas con otros médicos.', 'Aquí se muestra un ejemplo mediante telemedicina, de uno de nuestros neurooncólogos haciendo una interconsulta con un médico en otro país sobre un paciente complicado con un tumor cerebral.', 'Y este es sólo otro ejemplo donde estuve en Huangshan, China, e hicimos un comité virtual de telemedicina sobre tumores aquí con la Dra. Hope Rugo, que estaba en San Francisco en ese momento, para hablar sobre una paciente complicada con cáncer de mama.', 'Y aquí está, justo después de esto, una videoconferencia en la misma ubicación, sobre un paciente complejo de cáncer de colon con el Dr. Glen Balch que es jefe de cirugía colorrectal en Emory en Atlanta.', 'Nuevamente mostrando las ilustraciones de cómo los comités virtuales sobre tumores pueden ser utilizados para ayudar en el asesoramiento y recomendaciones para pacientes con cáncer complejo, ahora en cualquier parte del mundo.', 'Y he incluido esta diapositiva, de un resumen que se presentó el año pasado en la ASCO, que muestra que el 91% de los asistentes a comités virtuales sobre tumores lo consideraron muy útil, y el 100% de los asistentes notaron que la calidad de la atención mejoraba.', 'Muy bien, y de nuevo estamos casi terminando nuestra charla, voy a hacer el resumen en breve.', 'Y solo como recordatorio para utilicen los botones de Preguntas y respuestas a medida que resumo.', 'Entonces, como cirujanos ¿cómo nos adaptamos a un cambio en pacientes oncológicos que cambian rápidamente?', 'Está claro en los Estados Unidos y creo que en muchas partes de Europa y en otros lugares del mundo que muchos pacientes de cáncer recibirán más de una modalidad de tratamiento, y que la atención del cáncer contemporánea es un enfoque de equipo, que combina la sabiduría colectiva de cirujanos, oncólogos médicos, oncólogos radioterápicos y otras veces con su patología y oncología radioterápica.', 'Con los avances en la terapia sistémica eficaz es evidente que el cáncer se está convirtiendo en una enfermedad crónica o curable.', 'El cáncer de mama es un muy buen ejemplo de ello.', 'Y después de todos estos tratamientos intensivos, la supervivencia en pacientes que viven durante años después de su tratamiento están en riesgo de sufrir de segundas neoplasias primarias, cumplimiento del tratamiento y las consecuencias de su tratamiento intensivo multidisciplinario.', 'El campo de la oncología es una de las especialidades que más rápidamente avanza y cambia en toda la medicina, y eso significa que nosotros como cirujanos tenemos que mantenernos al día a través de la formación continua e incorporar estos cambios en el plan de estudios de nuestros alumnos.', 'Y también es importante validar estos avances en pacientes quirúrgicos sistemáticamente a través de ensayos clínicos.', 'Y como he tratado de enfatizar, hay una colaboración continua de organizaciones profesionales, especialmente en los Estados Unidos, en Europa, en la formación continua de médicos, que tiene que ocurrir permanentemente, y para mejorar el plan de estudios de los cirujanos generales y las especialidades de cirugía general en todas las instituciones del mundo.', 'Los cirujanos para lograr un mejor resultado van a tener que dividir a sus pacientes e identificar aquellos para los que la especialización o derivación a centros de alto volumen especializados en ciertas enfermedades tendrá un mejor resultado para el tratamiento de pacientes con cánceres complejos o avanzados.', 'Y existe una demanda pública e incluso gubernamental de obtener una atención óptima de especialistas, de centros oncológicos multidisciplinarios y de la regionalización de la terapia oncológica.', 'Sin embargo, es importante enfatizar que esto no significa que todos los pacientes con cáncer necesiten ser tratados por especialistas, especialmente si el diagnóstico se hace pronto y el tratamiento es estándar y no necesita múltiples especialidades para su atención.', 'Realmente creemos que los pacientes deben permanecer en su entorno local todo lo posible, y aquí es donde cosas como la telemedicina pueden desempeñar un papel para ayudar a garantizar que los pacientes, incluso en un hospital local más pequeño, reciban asesoramiento y planificación del tratamiento, con aportaciones de especialistas a través de la telemedicina o la interconsulta.', 'Y que quienes nos especializamos como oncólogos quirúrgicos, deberíamos ser líderes en formación e investigación entre la comunidad de cirugía general.', 'Ya casi termino con mi charla; en resumen, las sociedades profesionales, como la sociedad que represento, la Sociedad de Oncología Quirúrgica y antes fui Director Ejecutivo de ASCO, la SSO europea, el Colegio Americano de Cirujanos, la ASCO, son ejemplos de organizaciones que pueden ser componentes importantes para definir los estándares para tratar pacientes quirúrgicos con cáncer y proporcionar formación, capacitación, talleres para ayudar a otros cirujanos a lograr una atención óptima del cáncer.', 'Y que las asociaciones entre sus sociedades profesionales, que están bien desarrolladas entre los europeos en las organizaciones estadounidenses de SSO, mejorarán nuestra especialidad y la atención de nuestros pacientes.', 'Así que esa es mi conclusión, ahora voy a pasar el testigo al profesor Audisio para escuchar sus comentarios y para responder cualquier pregunta que puedan haber hecho durante esta exposición.', 'Muchas gracias.', 'Gracias Charles, no tenemos palabras para agradecerle al profesor Balch por resumir el presente y el futuro de la cirugía oncológica de buena calidad en todo el mundo.', 'Y realmente quiero decir todo el mundo porque no es sólo el procedimiento quirúrgico sofisticado, súper avanzado que se podría esperar de un centro de referencia de asistencia especializada avanzada, esta es una filosofía, esta es una actitud muy básica, que todos deberíamos adoptar incluso en un hospital general comarcal, hay espacio y hay necesidad de cierto tipo de cirujano, que sea consciente de la multidisciplinariedad de la práctica oncológica, y que fuera más propenso a hablar con diferentes especialistas, para luego ofrecer a sus propios pacientes el tratamiento más adecuado.', 'Entonces ¿estoy en lo correcto al decir, Profesor Balch, que el mensaje con el que hay que quedarse es que la cirugía oncológica de buena calidad es algo que se espera, que se demanda y que es una necesidad mundial no sólo de las principales unidades oncológicas, sino también de la todos los hospitales comarcales?', 'Eso es absolutamente cierto y creo que las organizaciones profesionales y los gobiernos de cada país tienen que insistir en que sus ciudadanos reciban atención de alta calidad y asegurar, en cada país, que haya cirujanos bien formados, que haya sistemas organizativos, como centros oncológicos regionales, y creo cada vez más que hay relaciones internacionales con personas u organizaciones, centros médicos y centros oncológicos, que pueden ser de ayuda para la interconsulta en pacientes complejos, y en la formación de los cirujanos en las comunidades locales e incluso en los centros oncológicos más provinciales o nacionales en los hospitales.', 'Por ejemplo, la semana que viene voy a formar un comité multidisciplinario sobre tumores con un hospital provincial de China, y parte del tema a tratar va a ser cómo podemos aumentar el uso de la videoconferencia para aumentar el acceso de los médicos en China con expertos para ayudar en la toma intelectual de decisiones para pacientes oncológicos complejos.', 'Creo que este es un tema muy candente y tal vez debamos dedicar un poco más de tiempo a pensar la mejor manera de facilitar esto.', 'Acabamos, acaba usted de señalar cómo esa red existe, y yo animaría a los jóvenes cirujanos en formación a que se sientan absolutamente libres de perseguir sus sueños, estudiar sus temas, y cuando se encuentren con el gran profesor en la reunión le tiren de la manga y, y, contacten con especialistas, especialistas de primer nivel, y que luego se sientan libres de comunicarse con ellos, tal vez entablen con ellos un debate y se sientan lo suficientemente cómodos como para aprovechar la gran red que está disponible a través de la SSO, la Sociedad Estadounidense de Oncología Quirúrgica, y la europea también; estamos trabajando en este momento para facilitársela a estos países en desarrollo en África, a través del fondo no restringido que las compañías farmacéuticas están poniendo a disposición, este es, en mi opinión, el camino a seguir.', 'Así que los animo a venir y hablar con el profesor Balch, conmigo mismo, y con quien quieran para mejorar sus conocimientos.', 'Creo que lo importante es que no podemos obligar a estos cambios, la iniciativa tiene que venir del cirujano en cada comunidad, de su hospital, y de su gobierno, tanto su gobierno local como su gobierno nacional, para elevar el nivel de expectativas para una atención de alta calidad y oportuna.', 'Y luego trabajar en cada país dentro de las limitaciones de sus recursos, para lograrlo con el tiempo.', 'Hagamos también alguna advertencia, algo fácil de entender sobre técnicas súper avanzadas, es decir, no quieres un escáner PET, cuando no tienes un ecógrafo.', 'Podrías no plantearte comprar un equipo robótico, cuando te falta un aparato básico de laparoscopia, y por lo tanto necesitas desarrollar el sistema, como usted dice, paso a paso, de acuerdo con las instalaciones locales a nivel regional o provincial.', 'Sí, es absolutamente cierto; he estado en un hospital importante en África que tiene una máquina de radioterapia muy cara que aún está en cajas porque no tienen los radiólogos o los técnicos en radiología para el componente de servicio, pero tienen la máquina en una caja, que alguien compró, pero no basta con eso.', 'Así que se necesita planificación a nivel gubernamental y hospitalario, para asegurarse de definir no sólo los gastos financieros en edificios y equipos sino también la ejecución de los servicios por individuos calificados y entrenados, a todos los niveles.', 'Así, Profesor Balch, siempre tenemos enemigos y aliados cuando queremos lograr un objetivo, y esa es una forma tonta y restrictiva de verlo, pero ha ocurrido que la mayoría de los oncólogos quirúrgicos culpen a los cirujanos generales por no adoptar una actitud o filosofía oncológica y, por otro lado, algunos oncólogos médicos están barriendo las habilidades de los cirujanos hasta esconderlas bajo la alfombra.', '¿Estamos en lo cierto al decir que realmente necesitamos a todos y les damos la bienvenida a todos a bordo, porque este es un debate en curso que es un placer crear juntos a medida que se desarrolla?', 'Estoy de acuerdo, y creo que el punto aquí es que el cirujano tiene que estar involucrado en la planificación del tratamiento.', 'Como usted y yo hemos comentado hay otras especialidades y cirujanos que pasan todo su tiempo en el quirófano, y permiten que el profesional con formación en medicina interna se ponga al frente y tome todas las decisiones y ahora en esa especialidad, y estoy hablando de cirugía cardíaca, el cirujano es el tribunal de último recurso, después de que todos los tratamientos médicos hayan fracasado.', 'Y me preocupa que si el cirujano no aporta la perspectiva quirúrgica a la planificación del tratamiento, y está involucrado con el oncólogo médico y el oncólogo radioterápico, los pacientes podrían no obtener todas las ventajas de un verdadero enfoque de tratamiento multidisciplinario que implique cirugía, pero estamos mejor entrenados y tenemos la experiencia para determinar cuál es el mejor momento de la cirugía en determinada combinación y secuencia.', 'Si no estamos sentados a la mesa, seremos el tribunal de último recurso después de que todo lo demás fracase con el tratamiento médico y la radioterapia.', 'Así que tenemos que participar en la planificación del tratamiento desde el principio.', 'Sí, bueno, una vez más adoptamos totalmente una actitud multidisciplinaria, donde cada vez más y más y quizás nuevas figuras están tomando parte, por ejemplo, pienso en radiólogos intervencionistas que hace tan sólo tal vez una o dos décadas eran casi desconocidos, pero hoy en día están las estenosis de endoprótesis vasculares, ellos colocan catéteres, administran medicación e isótopos, así que una vez más vamos a reiterar claramente la idea de que queremos a todos a bordo aquí.', 'Aprovecho el tiempo porque entiendo por parte del organizador que hay un problema con la recepción de las preguntas y este servicio no ha estado disponible hoy, hay un fallo técnico.', 'Así que nos disculparemos por esto y nos aseguraremos de que si tienen alguna pregunta puedan regresar, la audiencia puede contactar conmigo y con el profesor Balch por escrito y nos complacerá responderles o satisfacer cualquier solicitud.', 'Pero me complace mucho ser parte de esta importante sesión y unirme a usted, un oncólogo quirúrgico de renombre internacional, en este foro educativo por videoconferencia.', 'También estoy muy agradecido a la Escuela Europea de Oncología, porque a menudo sentimos que el equipo quirúrgico está un poco descuidado, así que me gustaría felicitar a la ESO por esto y quizás, en fin, retorcerles el brazo y asegurarse de que se otorgue más espacio y más interés a lo que están haciendo los cirujanos.', '¿Hay alguna nota concluyente que quiera destacar, profesor Balch?', 'Sí, me gustaría que me dieran la última palabra, mostré a propósito las diapositivas sobre el tratamiento del cáncer de mama en Gran Bretaña, una región de niveles altos de renta.', 'Y tengo entendido que después de esa época alrededor del año 2002-2004, el gobierno británico se puso manos a la obra para desarrollar los centros oncológicos, la regionalización y que la atención en el cáncer de mama ha mejorado enormemente.', 'Usted se mueve en ese ámbito y ha sido testigo de ello, ahora me pregunto si le gustaría comentar algo, porque una de las cuestiones importantes para nosotros es que se necesita cierto nivel de especialización, incluso en el cáncer de mama.', 'Está bien, voy a compartir mis opiniones con usted y los participantes.', 'Estoy seguro de que, espero no ofender a nadie, pero la historia dice que, cuando llegué a este país en 1999, la cirugía de mama estaba en manos de los cirujanos más torpes, quizás no estaban muy capacitados para una cirugía visceral, así que quedaban relegados a cirugías de cáncer subcutáneo.', 'Y por lo tanto, los resultados estéticos fueron terribles, y los resultados oncológicos también fueron muy, muy deficientes.', 'Y en esos días, todavía éramos presa de los egos, que usted sabe que los cirujanos lo pueden todo, o usted no lo necesita, yo le he curado, no necesita quimio, no necesita radio, solo regrese dentro de seis meses, de un año, y está arreglado.', 'Ahora, afortunadamente, ha habido un deseo, una decisión de crear cirujanos especializados en la mama.', 'Los viejos se han retirado y ahora hay cada vez más jóvenes que realmente se centran solamente en el cáncer de mama.', 'Y esto significa que no hacen guardias nocturnas, simplemente se centran en la cirugía del cáncer de mama.', 'También profesor Audisio, ¿no es cierto que se han establecido centros de oncología regionales que, no solo para el cáncer de mama, sino para otras enfermedades, ha elevado la calidad de la atención?', 'Sí, definitivamente, esto es especialmente cierto para la cirugía de cáncer avanzado, como señaló usted, la cirugía hepática, la cirugía pancreática, los sarcomas, la enfermedad peritoneal; no tiene sentido tener veinte unidades en todo el país, tenemos cuatro unidades acreditadas totalmente auditadas, y muy bien controladas y con un rendimiento maravilloso, así que ese es el escenario.', 'Pero el punto que quería dejar claro es que creo que la generación joven está aceptando, como decía usted antes, la idea de trabajar juntos y decidir: sí, esto es una cuestión quirúrgica, pero ¿en qué momento? ¿en qué pacientes? ¿cuán agresivos deberíamos ser?', '¿Y qué queda después de la cirugía?', 'Y, definitivamente, estamos mejorando en esto y los resultados están ahí, los resultados del cáncer han mejorado.', 'No estoy seguro de que pueda citarlo debido a la, esto, la creación del equipo multidisciplinario, pero es indudablemente cierto que esta filosofía cohesionada, este abordaje armónico de los pacientes con cáncer ha mejorado extraordinariamente los resultados.', 'Sí, y creo que la enseñanza, el resumen de toda esta charla es que los cirujanos tienen que desempeñar un papel en este campo de rápido avance y que lamentablemente miles de millones de personas no tienen acceso a una atención segura, asequible y oportuna.', 'Y creo que todos nosotros tenemos que intensificar nuestros esfuerzos para ayudar a los pacientes de cáncer de todo el mundo, para que, independientemente de dónde vivan, puedan tener acceso, ya sea a través de un médico local más formado y capacitado o mediante la derivación a un centro regional.', 'Y que el proceso formativo se mejore en todos los países para que todos podamos estar al día en este campo en rápido crecimiento y podamos introducir de manera segura estas nuevas terapias, a medida que estén aprobadas por los gobiernos y los planes de seguros.', 'Le estoy muy agradecido Profesor Balch por su tiempo, por su sabia visión y por compartir sus pensamientos con

            "['Hola a todos,', 'Es un placer estar aquí y haber sido invitado por el profesor Franco a compartir con ustedes mi experiencia sobre la evaluación de planes de tratamiento en radioterapia.', 'Soy Nuria Jorret. Soy consultor médico físico, jefe clínico de física de radiación en el hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau en Barcelona.', 'so the learning objectives of this lecture will be to give you an overview of the radiation therapy treatment process', 'we will analyze the different angles of treatment plan quality because at the end of this session i would like you to have a critical assessment of plan quality whenever you are facing a treatment plan produced by the medical physicist', \"and also because it's very important if you have to design the radiotherapy guidelines for clinical trials and also for internal treatment protocols\", 'so the revision therapy treatment what does it involve', 'Básicamente, tendremos un paciente que venga a nuestro departamento y el radiólogo decidirá si tratar y en este caso, prescribirá el tratamiento.', 'Entonces se someterá a alguna imagen, generalmente usando.', 'Y de esas imágenes, los radiólogos oncológicos delinearán los volúmenes que quieren tratar y los volúmenes que quieren proteger.', 'All this information will go to the physics department that they will work on their computers to produce a treatment plan achieving the treatment prescription of the radiation oncologist.', 'And here we will perform most of our plan evaluation.', 'Sin embargo, sabemos que este plan se entregará al paciente en diferentes fracciones.', 'The patient will come different days to the treatment, to the radiotherapy department, go into the treatment unit and we will deliver the treatment.', 'so the the thing that we should ask ourselves is whether this treatment that is being delivered agrees with the treatment that was planned and therefore with the treatment prescription by the radiation oncologist', 'so behind the scenes to make this happen so that we get a treatment that is the one that the radiation oncologist prescribed we are doing the physicist we are basically doing machine qa to warranty that everything is working fine', 'Estamos haciendo también el sistema de planificación de tratamiento.', 'Pero luego tenemos al paciente, la imagen, el plan.', 'and this part here even if we have this app under control we know that the patient also may change during the treatment for instance or that the machine the day of the treatment may not be performing as when we do our q a test', 'Entonces, ¿qué es la calidad plan?', 'De hecho, la calidad del plan es la aptitud clínica de la distribución de la dosis que se puede esperar razonablemente de un plan de tratamiento.', 'Así que calcularemos la dosis en las imágenes del paciente.', 'Y luego tendremos una evaluación de la dosis entregada, teniendo en cuenta la prescripción y también el volumen que ha sido delineado por el paciente.', \"i have put here realistically expected and it's basically because we have to take into account the uncertainties that we are facing when we are calculating the dose distribution but also delivering the dose distribution to a particular patient different actions\", 'so what are the inputs where these uncertainties come from', 'Así que básicamente, tenemos diferentes entradas, tenemos entradas que pertenecen al sistema de planificación del tren en sí.', 'Tenemos lo que llamamos el modelo B.', 'also we have how this dose is calculated inside the treatment patient', 'También tenemos el modelo de paciente.', 'Así que asumimos que el paciente, cuando tenemos las imágenes de CT y conocemos las densidades, y utilizamos esto, combinándolo con esto, para obtener la distribución final de dosis.', 'Y luego tenemos el plan de tratamiento.', 'So, and this will give us the dose distribution as is evaluated and approved by the radiation oncologist.', 'En el otro lado tenemos el tratamiento.', 'Y en el tratamiento, tendremos que considerar que tenemos el linac o la unidad de tratamiento.', 'Tenemos el paciente, el paciente real que viene a ser tratado.', 'Y luego tenemos el plan de tratamiento.', 'And this will give the deliver those distribution.', 'again if we want to assess the delivered dose distribution we will have to measure it somehow so we will have also some uncertainties here', 'Y compararemos estas dos cosas.', 'Y comparando estas dos cosas, diríamos, ok, el tratamiento fue el hígado como estaba planeado y como estaba prescrito.', 'Como pueden ver, todo esto es muy complejo y, por lo tanto, tenemos muchas incertidumbres que tenemos que tener en cuenta.', 'the the kind of basis of this this lecture is on this paper', 'there was a workshop organized by the physics committee in estro to discuss amongst experts what was plan quality in radiotherapy and also how we should evaluate the plan quality which metrics should we use', 'and we introduce you will see that the plant quality does not only depend on the calculated dose distribution but also we have to take into account the robustness and also the plant complexity', 'Y lo que haremos durante esta conferencia es ver estos tres componentes y entender mejor qué significan.', 'so the the the important message here is that plant quality is not only about the plant dose distribution', 'So basically, you have to look it from different angles to get the complete picture of how the plan at the end will be delivered.', 'Así que de nuevo, si vemos el tratamiento, tenemos al paciente aquí. Vemos que este paciente es un poco sobrepeso. Esa es una cosa. Vemos al paciente en la sesión. Está viniendo de manera diferente.', 'Así que esto es algo que no sucedió.', 'Pero de todos modos, tienes al paciente, vas a pasar por el plan ECT, vas a tener el modelo del paciente, el oncólogo tradicional, diseñará los volúmenes, prescribirá la dosis.', 'Y luego vamos a trazar un plan de tratamiento.', 'and we will provide the radiation oncology dose distribution that will be highly impacted by the accuracy of our dose calculation algorithms', 'This is something that the physicists know and the additional oncologists trust, well done, for trusting us on, uh, on that this is accurate.', 'but there are different uncertainties', 'Luego transferiremos todos los datos a nuestra unidad de tratamiento y el paciente vendrá para recibir el tratamiento.', 'Y usted dice que el paciente vendrá varias veces.', 'Así que tenemos que tener en cuenta la planabilidad del plan, lo que significa que es este plan que producimos en nuestro sistema de planificación de tratamiento, que se entrega bien por nuestra unidad de tratamiento.', 'can the treatment unit have some limitations and make that this plan is not delivered exactly as we thought', 'Country speed, live speed, these kind of things.', 'Y también tenemos que tener en cuenta, ya sabes, eso muy bien, porque todos estamos haciendo imágenes a bordo hoy en día, o la mayoría de nosotros, sabemos que el paciente puede cambiar de una fracción a la otra.', 'Así que tenemos que tener en cuenta también las variaciones de los pacientes. Y para hacer eso, tenemos que asegurarnos de que este plan sea robusto.', 'Así que tiene que ser robusto a las variaciones del paciente y también a la entrega del tratamiento.', 'Y esto es muy popular ahora con protones porque tenemos, sabemos que el rango está altamente afectado por las variaciones de los pacientes.', 'y todos escuchan o miran publicaciones sobre robustez de plan, pero es un concepto que puede ser, también debería aplicarse a nuestro estándar de medición usando fotones o electrones.', 'Así que recuerda que puedes publicar preguntas en el chat y el profesor Franco se encargará de ellas.', 'Así que comencemos con la distribución de dosis calculada.', \"it's the thing that usually we use to evaluate a plan\", 'Así que veamos este caso.', 'Así que, por lo general, lo que haremos es ir por las diapositivas, o esto es lo que deberíamos hacer.', 'Mirando la distribución de dosis.', 'this would be the best evaluation method to look at the dose distribution but we have to be very careful on how we we use the different isodose lines or the different tools that the treatment planning system has to show this distribution as slides by slides', 'so you can see here for instance all the isothermal scores', 'Puedes usar color wash con diferentes sabores, pero hay otras cosas que puedes ver.', 'You can look at profiles through different structures.', 'you can look at point dose iso dose surfaces etc etc but it is important to be careful with the visualization for instance um some some of our when we have the dosimetries coming to our department and they come from other department sometimes they only highlight ninety five percent iso dose line one hundred five and kind of seventy but they are missing all the others', 'Así que es algo que debemos considerar.', 'Así que ten cuidado cuando estés mirando eso.', 'De nuevo, si vas a través de este camino, miras todas las diapositivas, obtienes la distribución de tres D. Puedes tener muchas diapositivas, tienes muchas cajas.', 'Tienes una gran cantidad de información.', 'there is a complex relationship between those anatomy and clinical response', 'Es muy difícil de cuantificar y es difícil de evaluar el impacto clínico.', \"so you will have a flavor of how the distribution is but usually what radiation oncologists do is to look at the dose volume histogram which is a kind of summary or it's compacting all this information in ah in in an histogram the number of boxes receiving a certain dose\", 'and this is what usually we would the the radiation oncologist would look at and is what we use for treatment plan optimization nowadays', 'Hablemos un poco sobre esos histograma de volumen, que es lo que yo llamo el holi raja.', \"and i would like to be somehow critical to those at least to make you think what they really represent and what they really don't represent\", 'Entonces, ¿por qué estamos usando esos histogramas de volumen?', 'We are using those volume histograms because, um, the, uh, many years ago, uh, we', 'there was a publication on the red journal called quantic where the toxicity of our treatments was correlated to these some points on the dose volume history', 'so this is for the case of prostate and you can see that they compacted that they put together information from different groups treating prostate and they look for the dose limits for grade two rectal toxicity', 'Y se puede ver, por ejemplo, esta línea que muestra que hay un buen acuerdo con todos los grupos que para altas dosis, que se tiene, por ejemplo, que el volumen que recibe 70.', 'Setenta ray debería ser menos de veinte por ciento de volumen, de lo contrario, tenías un alto riesgo de tener una toxicidad rectal. Grado dos.', 'Pero para esta publicación, la mayoría de los parámetros del modelo se basaron en datos tratados, principalmente sin IMRT o localización diaria, por lo que no estaban haciendo IGRT.', 'Y la mayoría de los estudios usan 1.8 o 2 fracciones de grado.', 'so from these studies and again putting the example of prostate and rectum we the community agreed on some dose volume histogram constraints', 'And here you can see that dose-volume histogram constraints for rectal toxicity, uh, and, and you have different, different points in that, uh, dose-volume histogram.', 'This was revisited some years ago by Caroline Olson and in 2018. And you see that also for for prostate cancer treatments, they revisited these dose volume histogram constraints with new techniques being include with all the cases that were included were using ICRT.', 'it was with maximum nominal doses a little bit higher because we have been escalating those in prostate due to the advances in technology and with those fractions one point eight to three so not yet including as bric treatments for caltreatment or protons and you see that this has been revisited now and then', \"but but it's important for you to understand that this dose-volume histogram although it's a very nice tool because it compacts information it's kind of a safety net we use them for for optimization\", 'Esos histogramas de volumen pierden información especial.', 'So basically, if this is the rectum and you have this high dose spots here and there, or you have them concentrated in one region, the dose volume histogram will look exactly the same. So you are losing this spatial information.', 'and there is some evidence all evidence that a special distribution of these high doses really matters', 'so there is animal data from studies from truss in nineteen ninety five showing that colon radiation damage in rats depends on the size and shape of the irradiated surface', \"in human data however we don't have this collection of topographical kind of those distributions basically because now we have the computer power to kind of store all this data but we didn't have it before\", 'Otra cosa que es importante en esos histonemas de volumen es que como suele ser, usamos el porcentaje de volumen, dependiendo del total recto que conturremos, entonces el porcentaje de volumen cambiará. Así que depende de cómo normalizamos.', \"So it's something that you have to consider when you are comparing studies, you have to be very cautious of the length, for instance, of rectum that you are contorting, otherwise you could run into problems, basically because you would be comparing to the recommendations on the volume receiving a certain dose, but you would be with a different kind of percentage volume.\", 'Otra cosa en esos histogramas de volumen y para, por ejemplo, vejiga y recto es la pregunta de si podría ser más relevante en esos histogramas de superficie que un histograma de volumen. Y había bastante interés en eso. Hace muchos años, también, tenemos un puñado de publicaciones de físicos muy famosos que trabajan en este tipo de histogramas de superficie de los dos mil, dos mil cinco.', 'Pero en ese momento, la radioterapia conformal en 3D era el estándar de tratamiento y no encontraron muchas diferencias. Si comparan esos volúmenes, histograma, métricas basadas en volúmenes o superficies, pero esto fue porque básicamente, en ese momento, estábamos usando este tipo de tratamientos, que, en el proceso, era un tratamiento de cuatro cajas.', 'our dose distribution were very very similar and the dose volume histograms even if they lose special information described in a similar way those distributions that in the background were very very similar there was a correlation between the dose volume histogram metric and the three d dose distribution because we were doing more or less the same', '¿Qué pasa ahora?', 'now we have um modulation we have i m r t and b map we have different techniques and then we can have two histograms hiding completely different three d dose distributions in the background', 'so i did this exercise so i this is a protest and i play with it', \"I did a kind of lattice here and all these dose volume histograms they i can't match the um the um the dose volume histograms but what is behind them is a completely different dose distribution\", 'So at this moment, this nice correlation between the dose volume histogram metric and the 3D dose distribution is no longer true.', \"so what is the message um here it's basically that maybe is the moment to think on better metrics to describe the dose distribution so that we can better correlate this dose distribution to toxicity\", 'Y solo para mostrarles algo del trabajo que se está haciendo en este sentido. Aquí pueden ver cómo estamos revisitando de nuevo estos histogramas de superficie de dosis. Y no solo eso, sino también mirar dónde se concentran estas altas dosis en la superficie del recto y ver si esto se correlaciona con diferentes tipos de toxicidades.', 'so in this study but they they they find they find significant relations on defecation urgency and fecal leakage explained by high doses at the central and the upper part of the rectum and also emptying difficulties were explained by longitudinal extensions of intermediate doses', 'And this is, uh, another ex- study from Vox talks, uh, in 2015 also, and they look here at the delivered dose distribution by doing the same exercise.', 'So looking at the distribution of these high doses on the rectal surface and correlating them with the toxicity they found.', 'Other studies which are very powerful and are being performed by Italian colleagues, by Laura Cella and also Marcel van Erk at the Christie in Manchester, they are really looking at the distribution of the dose in the boxels and looking whether the boxels with high doses position correlate with the toxicity. And they have done that for the heart and lung treatments and this is giving really kind of very powerful data to understand better where are the issues when we are looking at the toxicity and not only looking at one point in the dose volume histogram.', \"so and this would be how do we assess the calculated dose distribution but now let's talk a little bit about robustness\", 'and and the robustness is related to the question whether we are one hundred percent sure that the dose volume histogram metrics match what the patient receives', 'Son los dos.', 'so basically all the studies i have shown on quantum they were looking at the plan those distribution and then they were looking at the toxicity but there can be a gap between what we think what we plan and what the patient receives', 'A menos que lo veamos ahora.', 'Así que básicamente este es el proceso en relación con el paciente específico y ahora nos centraremos en esta parte aquí, así que en el IGRP.', 'Y tenemos una herramienta muy poderosa para comprobar lo que estamos haciendo.', 'One is IGRT, so doing images before the treatment, during the treatment with the patient on the couch, every fraction.', 'and then also we can incorporate here if we do the symmetric measuring or assessing the dose during the treatment', 'Así que esto también viene del estudio Voxdox de los que estábamos hablando, y aquí están nuestros diez pacientes con próstata.', 'And you can see for each patient is one color and this is the difference in those okay in raised respect the volume of the rectus for each different fraction.', 'Y se puede ver que para recto, se puede tener diferencia para un paciente tan alto como el veinte por ciento, esos.', 'Sí, en 20.', 'No, pero sí, 2020.', 'Yo diría que es porcentaje.', 'Pero de todos modos, se puede ver que para algunos pacientes va bastante bien, para otros pacientes, se tiene una diferencia.', 'Si nos fijamos en la línea de 40 grados, podemos ver que podemos tener diferencia en el porcentaje de volumen de 40.', 'so it matters here is another study also from twenty ten and you can see how the rectum is changing from one fraction to the other and this has a high impact for some patients on the dose volume histogram um distribution', \"The these groups also saw is that the correlations with rectal bleeding and proctitis were achieved were stronger if we take into account the delivered dose and not the planned dose, which is something that if you think about it is rather obvious because it's what the patient has really received.\", 'therefore the thing is that we should try to match as much as possible the dose distribution that we have planned to the dose distribution that we are delivering or we should calculate what the patient has received to use this information to drive the models on toxicity for instance', 'and this is how we could go so what i was telling either we estimate the deliver those metrics or we try to deliver those matches as much as possible the plan those', '¿Cómo podemos hacer eso?', 'Con instrucciones del paciente, preparación.', \"so that it's very consistent between planning and delivery to use icrt image guidance with combeimct or now with the marlinex to look at the registration surrogates\", 'Así que esto es muy importante.', 'Así que para entrenar los rtts en las unidades de entrenamiento, cómo deberían coincidir y cómo deberían evaluar estas imágenes igrt, podemos adaptarnos, podemos rastrear o podemos hacer planes robustos o probabilísticos.', 'Así que aquí tenemos un resumen de dónde estamos ahora.', 'Así que estamos viendo la dosis que se le entrega al paciente y podemos tener estas incertidumbres teniendo un impacto aquí.', 'Así que la incertidumbre en el flujo emitido, el linac o la incertidumbre en esos cálculos, los analizaremos después, que será la complejidad del plan.', 'Pero ahora estamos mirando básicamente la incertidumbre geométrica con el paciente, la configuración del paciente, los cambios anatómicos de los movimientos y los cambios de densidad dentro del paciente.', 'Y esto es lo que llamaremos la robustez de la planta.', 'Así, en un plan robusto, el CTV recibirá la dosis prescrita y los tejidos normales cumplirán con las restricciones, a pesar de todas las incertidumbres que tenemos.', 'Así que un buen plan de tratamiento debe tener una buena distribución, pero también debe ser robusto para estas diferencias potenciales en el tratamiento diario del paciente.', '¿Cómo podemos hacer un plan robusto?', 'Hay un método que hemos estado usando durante cuatro años, que es el margen.', 'Así que podemos usar márgenes, tanto en el volumen objetivo clínico.', 'Y derivamos el volumen de trabajo de planificación de tratamiento para estar seguros de que incluso el CTB se mueve dentro del PTV, ya que estamos irradiando homogéneamente o estamos asegurándonos de que el PTV se irradia con la dosis prescrita. Significa que el CTB en todo momento recibirá la dosis prescrita.', 'Y también podemos hacer eso con los órganos en riesgo y definir el PRB, el volumen de planificación.', 'anyway we know that the marginal approach has several limitations', \"One of the major limitations is that basically it assumes static dose cloud calculation. And this means that it doesn't account, for instance, if there is any error on the rectum, which would modify the dose distribution, this dose distribution would not be modified by would would would had an impact on the on the coverage or the those at organs at risk that we wouldn't solve with this with this margin approaches.\", 'Another way to go on is with the robust optimization and robust evaluation.', 'this is the modern approach where it is much more sophisticated and takes the uncertainties explicitly into account', 'Así que se toma en cuenta, miramos diferentes escenarios. Así que tenemos diferentes, por ejemplo, diferentes ciudades, diferentes ciudades comunes. Y luego tomamos en consideración todas estas posibilidades de ese paciente, ese paciente completo. Y esto resolverá, resolverá el enfoque marginal, porque básicamente, dejamos de usar márgenes y miramos este plan probabilístico para hacer este plan robusto.', 'Otra forma, por ejemplo, interesante para hacer que el plan, por ejemplo, un plan de seno robusto, es el uso de volúmenes virtuales. Así que forzamos al sistema de planificación de la terapia a entregar un fluido homogéneo fuera del cuerpo para tener en cuenta el hecho de que, con la respiración, el paciente moverá el seno. Y necesitamos que este seno siga estando dentro de la distribución de dosis.', 'This is a static dose distribution, we will refer to it.', 'Al hacer eso, al hacer B-MAT con este bolus virtual, estamos asegurando que este plan, el CTB, estará cubierto, independientemente de la fase de respiración del paciente.', 'This was done uh on three d conform.', \"so if you are still using three d conformal for the breast you know that usually you open the the the beam that it goes it's not um matching the surface of the city of the breast on the city but you open it a little bit more to account for that\", 'Y tienes que tomar esto también en cuenta cuando estás haciendo planificación de BMAP.', 'this is some images on how you do that', \"let's move now to the plan complexity\", 'And the plan complexity basically looks at the characteristics of the plan from a mechanical point of view that make the plan difficult to be delivered by the treatment machine.', 'Y también poner algunos desafíos al sistema de planificación de tratamiento, precisión de cálculo.', 'Y básicamente, estos son el tamaño de la abertura y la irregularidad, y también la velocidad del rancho y esas tasas.', 'so um why is this plan complexity important', 'because this the calculation uncertainties will depend on plan complexity', 'For instance, one thing that is a lot well for the physicists, but you know that the MLCs how they are built, they have what we call tongue and groove. So the the leaves move like this and there is in order to avoid having a leakage, there is kind of a small step that makes the leaves move this way.', \"so and this this smallest tip that is made because we don't want to have leakage has to be modelled in the treatment planning system and for most planning systems this model of this of the mnc is not perfect\", 'Significa que tendremos mucho de Tom y grupo.', 'Así que estos son pasos más pequeños que van en y fuera de la viga.', 'this can impact our those calculation uncertainties so and those calculations will be not as accurate as we think also the small fields present challenges in the those calculation and also then the delivery uncertainties', 'So the delivery and service depend on the plan complexity.', 'Y luego el físico común dice, está bien, hago la medición.', 'so what are you telling me so i am getting excellent results with high complex plans but anyway reducing these uncertainties is still important because we want to deliver the desired dose distribution to the patients', 'Así que tener esto bajo control es importante.', \"so let's get the best plan we can with the lower complexity and the higher robustness\", 'so and this is what i was telling', 'so a highly complex balance involves small and more irregular msn c apertures larger tone and group effects higher modulation of dynamic parameters higher monitor units and more infractions movements and interplay effects', 'so in summary plans with low complexity have less uncertainties and we have more accurate those calculations the treatment planning system and better accuracy and robustness in treatment delivery', 'So this, uh, we could, uh, look at, for instance, this would be the plan quality, a plan score, and the plan irregularity.', 'We could think that, okay, um, increasing the, uh, plan irregularity, which is a complexity score, will means that we will have a better dose distribution. But you see that this is not the case.', 'Así que esto es diferente, eh, diferentes centros.', 'conducido el mismo caso, usan el mismo BMAP, el mismo TPS, similarmente en Linux, y se puede ver cómo diferentes centros, incluso teniendo un muy alto planificador.', 'the planet score is based on the dose distribution on the achievement achievement of the dose constraints', 'Y luego esos objetivos establecidos por el radiólogo.', 'Puedes ver que muy alto plan es corto.', 'they have a complete range of different planning regularities which is one of the complexity scores', 'Está bien.', 'Así que probablemente estos son planes innecesariamente complejos.', 'Y estos serán los planes óptimos.', 'Así, una baja irregularidad del plan con una muy alta puntuación del plan con respecto a la consecución de esas restricciones y esos objetivos en los PTVs.', 'Y esto podría ser subóptima, pues.', 'Y esto sería peor, porque no alcanzan este plan, no es core, y tienen de alguna manera una alta plan irregularidad.', 'so in summary treatment plan quality depends on the calculated dose distribution', 'Y recuerda, este es un escenario nominal, pero no es la dosis que le entregues al paciente.', 'y los oncólogos radiactivos.', 'Tienes que ser muy consciente de que a veces, porque quieres bajar las puertas al recto, entonces tendrás una fluidez.', 'Look at the plan slide by slide.', 'you may find that you have a very high dose very near the rectum because you are pushing the fluid out of the rectum', 'que esos tiene que ser algún trabajo', 'Y significa que este plan será muy bueno.', \"The robustness will not be very good because if the rectum moves, this 105% that you have been near the rectum, but you don't see in the dose volume histogram, it may go down to the rectum on the third fraction.\", 'Y robustez.', 'so look at the geometric and anatomical uncertainties and then the complexity the uncertainties in the dose calculation and the muted flowance and you have to have these three things on your mind when you are looking at one plan so how do i see a treatment plan treatment planning in in some years from now', 'so basically what i would like to see is that we have a patient data from ah from the radiation oncologist we would have for that patient that particular patient with that characteristics a predictive model so that we could have a personalized ntcp that will drive us to a personalized dose volume histogram constraints', 'or i would rather look at kind of the dose distribution three d kind of type of constraints', 'and we could have some personalized optimization goals that then we can ah compare with the treatment planning um the treatment plan', 'Y esto básicamente tiene que ir a través, yo diría, AI puede ayudarnos a hacer eso, pero tenemos que ser cautelosos de una cosa.', 'Y así, cuando trabajamos en NI, podemos tener la distribución de dosis en 3D, todos los voxel, este tipo de enfoques que han sido realizados por el grupo de Marcel Van Eyck y Laura Sella.', 'Pero, por favor, tenga en cuenta que un modelo no dura para siempre.', 'So you have to fit the model again and again every time you are changing techniques, the patients also change, the basic characteristics change.', 'Así que todo esto tiene que encajar en el modelo para que se pueda retratar.', 'Y con eso, me gustaría agradecer a algunos de mis colegas que me han ayudado durante muchos años en las discusiones sobre la calidad de los planes.', 'Victor, Jordi y Diego, y estoy abierto a cualquier pregunta que puedas tener.', 'Gracias por su atención.', 'Muchas gracias.', 'Gracias Nuria por esta excelente charla, ha sido muy inspiradora, diría yo.', 'and so we will be more than happy of course to receive your comments and and questions', 'So, I mean, feel free to to do that.', \"so noria i think i took some notes while you were um talking and and um um there's some like several points that i would want to address\", 'so you you nicely um saw that that whenever evaluating the quality of ah of a treatment plan we need to deal with complexity and i mean complexity is one of the issues that you address but i would say like ah generally speaking the the the topic is is is complicated', 'I would say in is the articulated', 'and sometimes we as as a radiation oncologist as clinicians tend to underestimate the different characteristics that we would need to focus on to be able to to judge properly a treatment plan', 'So some of the the um the the topic that you address are are are quite important.', \"So the the let's say limitation of the d. v. h. .\", \"So le le le le le le le le say let's um focus on calculated those those distributions.\", \"we tend to focus on dbh dbh has a limit probably those surface histograms are are better and and probably to have a better anatomical let's say representation out of the dots distribution we need to go for um those maps\", 'Yo diría.', 'S some of the points that you touched are are very important.', 'So for example, the the way we de the delineate an organ at risk is is crucial.', 'Of course, there is no consensus.', \"there's some initiative that are trying to reach a consensus\", 'Algunos son nacionales, otros son internacionales.', \"and but we we really need to know when whenever we we let's say also evaluating clinical result and comparing clinical results\", 'and and particularly when we compare toxicity of the treatment sometimes we really are talking about different things because the organ risk has been delineated in a different way', 'Y así, a veces, es difícil comparar los resultados.', \"So of course an effort in terms of harmonization, I think is it's very, it will be very important.\", 'ah then that the problem of endpoints right', 'because whenever we we use those constraints or those objectives then we need to set up some endpoints', 'and and the priority of the endpoints could be different', \"and it's normally it's chosen by the um the doctor let's say or the physician or by the clinician or by the the team treating the patient and not by the patient\", 'and sometimes the endpoints could be very different depending on the patient you are you are treating and this is not taken into account', 'and the other point is is that the i mean the plan quality you get from a medical physicist depends probably on the number of iteration right', \"so when you treated complexity you say you don't need to go for unnecessarily complicated and complex plan you should stay on the optimal plan but sometimes plans are kind of too let's say basic\", \"you do some number of iterations then you reach your objectives but probably by doing more iterations you could still go and reduce the let's say the the the the i mean have a better d v h in in that so probably sometimes automation could could could help\", 'so i would maybe want to have your opinion on the endpoints the problem of endpoints the problem of harmonization of contours but also the probably the issue of automation and how to probably improve the way we plan', 'Sí, definitivamente.', 'So uh we we have gone through that.', 'Así que estamos, tenemos, por ejemplo, nuestra institución.', 'We have nine dosimetrists and we are six physicists on radiation oncology clinical physicists.', 'And basically what we found, for instance, in prostate and rectum, where we have gone through automation, was that depending on who was taking the dosimetry, basically the plan, you were going through more iterations than somebody else.', 'Así que básicamente, podrías mejorar, podrías impulsar esa historia.', 'so that that has been kind of um standardized now with two things', 'First, on the on being very, very insisting a lot on the radiation oncologist on the contouring of the rectum, we have a peer review session looking at the contours every morning on all patients.', 'Así que hemos llegado a un consenso. Eso es muy importante cuando también estás tratando de automatizar la planificación.', 'Así que tienes que tener cosas bastante estandarizadas, también, desde el punto de vista de control.', 'and then now with the automation we have been able first to to kind of get very good those volume history regarding organs at risk without losing coverage of of our ptvs but also keeping the complexity under some three schools', 'Así que básicamente, cuando no lo hacemos, cuando lo hacemos, cuando entrenamos a nuestro modelo, tenemos un plan rápido.', 'We were taking plans that we knew that the complexity scores were reasonable.', 'so we were going through ah through we we we have an independent program because this is unfortunately is not implemented in full i would say in most treatment planning systems but we we knew that those treatment plans had gone through the through the metrics for treatment complexity', 'what we um is more more difficult for us to do is looking at the plan robustness', 'Así que el problema del plan es algo que realmente es, es, creo que es muy, es un problema clínico y es algo porque la complejidad del plan son algunas métricas que los físicos hacen y las mantenemos bajo control, ya sabes, el profesor Franco.', 'ah but the the thing is that um the the plan robustness is something that the clinicians have to be used to look at the um those distribution', 'If you are using kind of color wash, put 100, 100, 6 and look where this those are.', 'for instance and for a prostate look if they are very near the rectum because it means that probably the dose optimization has been pushed a lot to get the dose out of the rectum but you you have a dose distribution that is not very robust to the position of the rectum', 'Si se mueve ligeramente en este 105, 110 o 7 puede caer en el recto.', 'Lo mismo para el cuello.', 'Así que para HetaNet es otro buen ejemplo.', 'so you can for instance we we can push the the the forty base iso line', 'I to those out of the spinal cord.', 'Y puedo hacer un excelente histograma de dosis, porque está casi allí, pero no está tocando la médula espinal, pero está demasiado cerca.', 'so to have this idea that you have some points that really really or for instance you have some maxima near the spinal cord that small movement means that you can have the one hundred and seven inside is something that it has to be looked and you can only see that by looking at the dose at the dose distribution', 'Y todavía no tenemos las herramientas en los sistemas de planificación de la vivienda, pero nunca las tendremos si los profesionales no piden.', 'Ese es mi mensaje.', 'Así que básicamente, si no vamos a los proveedores y decimos, Hey, voy, este es el plan.', 'Quiero también cuatro fotos.', 'Quiero estar seguro de que mi plan es robusto a los movimientos.', 'Quiero hacer un probablistico plan en fotos también, porque esto será.', 'I am a believer.', 'Yo diría que esto tendrá un alto impacto para los pacientes, porque cuanto más robusto es el plan, más consistente es en toda la tratamiento.', 'and then when we start looking at the toxicity you have said there are several things standardization of volumes are also looking at the the robustness of the plan', 'Estas dos cosas son muy importantes para poder alimentar nuestros modelos predictivos y hacerlos un poco significativos.', 'Y fiable.', 'Sí.', 'Sí, es lo que es.', '¿Tú?', 'And Nuria, do you think you touch upon uh robustness?', '¿Crees que los nuevos enfoques que se están utilizando, como la reoptimización diaria, que se puede hacer, por supuesto, con una nueva máquina, o con una base de VCT, cambiaría el enfoque?

            "['Hello everybody.', \"So, it's a pleasure to be here, and to have been invited by Professor Franco, to share with you my experience on the evaluation of treatment plans in radiation therapy.\", 'I am Nuria Jornet, I am Consultant Medical Physicist, Clinical Head for Radiotherapy Physics, in the Hospital of la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, in Barcelona.', 'So, the learning objectives of this lecture will be to give you an overview of the radiation therapy treatment process.', 'We will analyse the different angles of treatment plan quality, because at the end of this session, I would like you to have a critical assessment of plan quality whenever you are facing a treatment plan produced by the medical physicist.', \"And also, because it's very important if you have to design radiotherapy guidance for clinical trials, and also for internal treatment protocols.\", 'So, radiation therapy treatment, what does it involve?', \"Basically, we'll have a patient come into our department, and the radiation oncologist will decide whether to treat, and in this case, he will prescribe the treatment.\", 'Then he will go under some imaging, usually using CT.', 'And from those images the radiation oncologist will delineate the volumes that they want to treat and the volumes they want to protect.', 'All this information will go to the physics department, that they will work on their computers to produce a treatment plan, achieving the treatment prescription of the radiation oncologist.', 'And here we will perform most of our plan evaluation.', 'However, we know that this plan will be delivered to the patient in different fractions.', 'The patient will come, different days, to the treatment, to the radiation therapy department, go into the treatment unit, and we will deliver the treatment.', 'So, the thing that we should ask ourselves is whether this treatment that is being delivered, agrees with the treatment that was planned, and therefore with the treatment prescription by the radiation oncologist.', 'So, behind the scenes to make this happen, so that we get a treatment, that is the one that the radiation oncologist prescribed, we are doing, the physicists, we are basically doing machine QA to guarantee that everything is working fine.', 'We are doing also Treatment Planning System QA; we have a standard test for that.', 'But then we have the patient, the imaging, treatment planning.', 'And this part here, even if we have this under control, we know that the patient also may change something in the treatment, for instance, or that the machine, the day of the treatment, may not be performing as well with our QA tests.', 'So, what is plan quality?', 'In fact, plan quality is the clinical suitability of the delivered dose distribution that can be realistically expected from a treatment plan.', 'So, we will calculate the dose on the images of the patient.', 'And then we will have an assessment of the delivered dose, taking into account the prescription, and also the volume that had been delineated by the patient.', 'I have put here \" realistically expected\", and it\\'s basically because, we have to take into account the uncertainties that we are facing when we are calculating the dose distribution, but also delivering the dose distribution to a particular patient, different fractions.', 'So, what are the inputs where these uncertainties come from?', 'So basically, we have different inputs, we have inputs which belong to the treatment planning system itself.', 'We have what we call the Beam model.', 'Also, we have how this dose is calculated inside the treatment patient.', 'We also then, we have the Patient model.', 'So, we assume that the patient, when we have the CT images and we know the densities, and we will use this combined with this to get the final dose distribution.', 'And then we have the Treatment Plan.', 'So, this will give us the dose distribution as is evaluated and approved by the radiation oncologist.', 'On the other side, we have the treatment.', 'And in the treatment, we have to consider that we have the LINAC, or the treatment unit.', 'We have the patient, the real patient that is coming to be treated.', 'And then we have the Treatment Plan.', 'And this will give the delivered dose distribution.', 'Again, if we want to assess the delivered dose distribution, we will have to measure it somehow, so we will have also some uncertainties here.', 'And we will compare these two things.', 'And by comparing these two things, we will say, \" Okay, the treatment was delivered as it was planned, and as it was prescribed\".', 'As you can see, all this is very complex, and therefore we have a lot of uncertainties that we have to take into consideration.', 'The basis of this lecture is on this paper.', 'There was a workshop organized by the Physics Committee in ESTRO, to discuss amongst experts, what was plan quality in radiotherapy, and also how we should evaluate the plan quality, which metrics should we use?', 'And we introduce, you will see, that the plan quality does not only depend on the calculated dose distribution, but also, we have to take into account the robustness and also the plan complexity.', \"And what we'll be doing during this lecture is to look at these three components and understand better, what do they mean?\", 'So, the important message here is that plan quality is not only about the planned dose distribution.', 'So basically, you have to look at it from different angles to get the complete picture of how the plan at the end will be delivered.', \"So again, if we see the treatment plan, we have the patient here, you see that this patient is a little bit overweight, that's one thing to see, for the patient on the session is coming differently.\", 'So, this is something that can happen.', 'But anyway, you have the patient, you will go through the planning CT, you will have the patient model, the radiation oncologist will design the volumes, will prescribe the dose.', 'And then we will go through treatment planning.', 'And we will provide the radiation oncology a dose distribution, that will be highly impacted by the accuracy of our dose calculation algorithms.', 'This is something that the physicists know, and the radiation oncologists trust, hold on, for trusting us, on that this is accurate.', 'But there are different uncertainties.', 'Then, we will transfer all the data to our treatment unit, and the patient will come for treatment delivery.', 'And you see that the patient will come several times.', 'So, we have to take into account the plan deliverability, which means, is this plan that we produce in our treatment planning system, being well-delivered by our treatment unit?', 'Can the treatment unit have some limitations that mean that this plan is not delivered exactly as we thought?', 'Gantry speeds, multi-leaf speeds, these kinds of things.', 'And also, we have to account, that very well because we are all doing onboard imaging nowadays, or most of us, we know that the patient may change from one fraction to the other.', 'So, we have to account also for patient radiation, and in order to do that, we have to ensure that this plan is robust.', 'So, it has to be robust to the patient variations, and also to the treatment delivery.', 'And this is very popular now with protons, because we have, we know that range is highly affected by the patient variations.', \"And everybody listens or looks at publications on planned robustness, but it's a concept that can be... it should be also applied to our standard treatments using protons or electrons.\", \"So, remember that you can post questions on the chat, and Professor Franco we'll take care of them.\", \"So, let's start, let's start with the calculated dose distribution.\", \"It's the thing that usually we use to evaluate a plan.\", \"So, let's look at this case.\", 'So usually what we will do, is going slice by slice, or this is what we should do.', \"Looking at the dose's distribution.\", 'This would be the best evaluation method to look at the dose distribution, but we have to be very careful on how, we use the different Isodose lines or the different tools that the treatment planning system has to show this distribution is slice by slice.', 'So, you can see here, for instance, all the isodose curves.', 'You can use colour wash with different labels, but there are other things that you can look at.', 'You can look at profiles through different structures.', 'You can look at point dose, Isodose surfaces, etc. but it is important to be careful with the visualization, for instance, some of our, when we have the Dosimetrist coming to our department and they come from other department, sometimes they only highlight 95% Isodose line, 105% and kind of 107%, but they are missing all the others.', \"So, it's something that we should consider.\", 'So be careful when you are looking at that.', 'Again, if you go through this path, you look at all these slice, you get the 3D dose distribution, you may have many slices, you have a lot of voxels.', 'You have huge amount of information.', 'There is a complex relationship between dose-anatomy and clinical response.', \"It's very difficult to quantify, as difficult to assess the clinical impact.\", \"So you will have a flavour of how this distribution but usually what traditional oncologists do, is too look at the dose-volume histograms which is a kind of summary, or it's compacting all this information in a histogram, the number of boxes, prescribing a certain dose.\", \"And this is quite usually we would, the radiation oncologist would look at, and it's what we use for treatment plan optimization, nowadays.\", \"Let's talk a little bit about Dose-volume histograms, which is what I call the Holy grail.\", \"And I would like to be somehow critical to those, at least to make you think but they really represent what they really don't represent.\", 'So why we are using dose-volume histograms?', 'We are using dose-volume histograms because many years ago, we...', 'There was a publication on the Red Journal of QUANTEC, where the toxicity of our treatments was correlated to these some points on the dose-volume histogram.', 'So, this is for the case of prostate, and you can see that they compacted, they put together information from different groups, treating prostate, and they look for the dose limits for grade two rectal toxicity.', 'And you can see, for instance, these lines, showing that there is quite a lot of good agreement with all the groups that for high doses that you have, for instance, that the volume receiving 70%...', '70 Gy should be less than 20% volume, otherwise you had a high risk, to have rectal toxicity grade two.', \"But for this publication, most of the model parameters were based on patients treated mostly without IMRT, or daily localization, so they we're not doing IGRT.\", 'And most of the studies used 1.8 or 2 Gy fractions.', 'So, from these studies, and again, putting the example of prostate and rectum, we, the community agreed on some, Dose Volumes Histogram constraints.', 'And here you can see the dose-volume histogram constraints for rectal toxicity, and you have different points in that dose volumes histogram.', 'This was revisited some years ago by Caroline Olsson, and in 2018 and you see that also for, for prostate cancer treatments, they revisited this dose-volume histogram constraints with new techniques being include, with all the cases that were included, when using IGRT.', 'It was with maximum nominal doses, little bit higher, because we have been escalating dose in prostate due to the advances in technology, and with dose fractions, 1.8 to 3 so not yet, including SBRT treatments, focal treatments, or protons, and you see that this has been revisited now and then.', \"But what is important for you to understand that this dose-volume histogram, although it's very nice tool because it compacts information, it's kind of a safety net, we use them for, optimization.\", 'Dose-volume histograms lose, spatial information.', 'So basically, if this is the rectal, and you have this high dose spots here and there, or you have them concentrated in one region, the dose-volume histogram will look exactly the same, so you are losing this special information.', 'And there is some evidence, old evidence that spatial distribution of this high doses really matters.', 'So, there is animal data from the studies from Trott in 1995, showing that colon radiation damage in rats depends on the size and shape of the radiated surface.', \"In human data, however, we don't have this collection of topographical kind of dose distributions, basically because now we have the computer power to, kind of store all this data, but we didn't have it before.\", 'Another thing that is important in dose-volume histogram, is that as usually we use the percentage of volume depending on the total rectum that we contour, then the percentage volume will change, so it depends on how you normalize.', \"So, it's something that you have to consider when you are comparing studies, you have to be very cautious of the land for instance, of rectum that you are contouring, otherwise you could run into problems, basically because you would be comparing, to the recommendations on the volume receiving a certain dose, but you would be with a different kind of percentage volume.\", 'Another thing in dose-volume histograms, and for instance, bladder and rectum is the question whether it could be more relevant a dose-surface histogram, than a volume histogram, and there was quite an interest on that many years ago, so we have a handful of publications of very famous physicists working on this kind of dose-surface histograms from the 2000-2005.', \"But at that moment, the 3D conformal radiotherapy was the standard of treatment, and they didn't find many differences while if they compare dose-volume histogram metrics based on volumes or surface, but this was because basically at that time, we were using these types of treatments, which employed a treatment planning process based on four-field box treatment.\", 'Our dose distribution was very, very similar and the dose-volume histograms, even if they lose, special information, described in a similar way, dose distributions that in the background were very, very similar, there was a correlation between the dose-volume histogram metric and the 3D doses distribution because we were doing more or less the same.', 'What happens now?', 'Now we have modulation, we have IMRT and VMAT, we have different techniques, and then we can have two histograms hiding, completely different 3D dose distributions in the background.', 'So, I did this exercise, so this is a prostate and I played with it.', 'I did that kind of lattice here and all these, dose-volume histograms, they, I can match, the dose-volume histograms, but what is behind them is a completely different dose distribution.', 'So, at this moment, this nice correlation between the dose volume histogram metric and the 3D dose distribution is not longer through.', \"So, what is the message here, is basically that maybe it's the moment to think on better metrics to describe dose distribution so that we can better correlate these, the dose distribution to toxicity.\", 'And just to show you some of the work that is being done in this respect, here you can see how we are revisiting again, these, dose-surface histogram, and not only that, but also looking at where these high doses concentrate in the surface of the rectum and seeing whether this correlates to different types of toxicities.', 'So in this study, they find significant relations on the defecation urgency and faecal leakage explained by high doses at the central, and the upper part of the rectum and also emptying difficulties were explained by longitudinal extensions of intermediate doses.', 'This is another study from VoxTox in 2015 also, and they look here at the delivered dose distribution by doing the same exercise.', 'So, looking at the distribution of these high doses on the rectal surface and correlating them with the toxicity they found.', \"Other studies, which are really powerful and are being performed by Italian colleagues, by Laura Cella and Marcel van Herk, at the Christie's in Manchester, they are really looking at the distribution of the doses with the boxes and looking whether the boxes with high doses position correlate with the toxicity, and they have done that for the heart and lung treatments, and this is giving really kind of a very powerful data to understand better where are the issues, when we are looking at the toxicity and not only looking at one point in the dose-volume histogram.\", \"So, and this could be, how do we assess the calculated dose distribution, but now let's talk a little bit about robustness.\", 'And the robustness is related to the question, whether we are 100% sure that the dose-volume histogram metrics match what the patient receives.', \"It's another thing.\", 'So basically, all the studies I have shown, they were looking at the plan dose distribution, and they were looking at the toxicity, but there can be a gap between what we think, what we plan, and what the patient receives.', 'And we will look at this now.', 'So basically, this is the process on a regarding patient specific QA, and now we will focus on this part here so on the IGRT.', 'Now we have a very powerful tool to check what we are doing.', 'One is IGRT, so doing images before the treatment, during the treatment with the patient on the couch, every fraction.', 'And then also we can incorporate here, In vivo dosimetry measuring or assessing the dose during the treatment.', \"So, this is also from VoxTox study we were talking about, and, and here's our 10 prostate patients.\", 'And you can see each patient is one colour, and this is the difference in dose, okay, in Gy, respect the volume of the rectum for each different fraction.', 'And you can see that for the rectum, you can have difference for one patient as high as 20% dose.', 'No, 20 Gy.', 'No, 20%...', 'I would say, percentage.', 'But anyway, you can see that for some patients, it goes quite well, for the patients you have a difference.', 'If you look at the 40 Gy Isoline, you can see that you can have difference in the percentage volume of 40%.', 'So, in matters, here is another study also from 2010, and you can see how the rectum is changing from one fraction to the other, and this has a high impact for some patients on the dose-volume histogram distribution.', \"These groups also saw is that the correlations with rectal bleeding and proctitis were achieved were stronger, if we take into account the delivered dose and not the planned dose, which is something that if you think about it, is rather obvious because it's what the patient has really received.\", 'The thing is that we should try to match as much as possible, the dose distribution that we have planned with the dose distribution that we are delivering, or we should calculate what the patient has received to use this information, to drive the models on toxicity, for instance.', 'And this is how we could go, So, what I was telling either we estimate the delivered dose metrics, or we try that the delivered dose matches as much as possible, the planned dose.', 'How can we do that?', 'With patient instructions, preparation...', \"So that, it's very consistent between planning and delivery, to use IGRT, image guidance with cone beam CT or magnetic resonance, to look at the registration surrogates.\", 'So, this is very important.', 'So, to train the RTTs in the treatment units, how they should match and how they should evaluate these IGRT images, we can adapt, we can track, or we can do robust or probabilistic plan planning.', 'So here we have a summary of where we are at now.', 'So, we are looking at the dose delivered to the patient, and we can have these uncertainties being, having an impact here.', \"So, the uncertainty in the 'emitted fluence' the linac or the uncertainty in dose calculations, we will look at it afterwards, which will be the plan complexity.\", 'But now we are looking basically at the geometric uncertainty with the patient, patient setup the anatomical changes or movements and the density changes inside the patient.', 'And this is what we would call the robustness of the plan.', 'So, in a robust plan, the CTV will receive the prescribed dose and the normal tissues will fulfil the restrictions, despite all the uncertainties we have.', 'So, a good treatment plan should have a good dose distribution, but also it should be robust to this, potential differences on the day- to-day treatment on the patient.', 'How we can make a plan robust?', 'There is one method that we have been using for years, which is the margins.', 'So, we can use margins both in the clinical target volume.', \"And we drive the treatment-planning volume to be sure, that even the CTV moves within the PTV, as we are evaluating homogeneously, or we are ensuring that the PTV is radiated with the prescribed dose, it means that the CTV will receive the dose that's prescribed.\", 'And we also can do that with the organs at risk, and define the PRVs, the planning risk volume.', 'Anyway, we know that the Margin approach has several limitations.', \"One of the major limitations is that basically it assumes a static dose cloud calculation, and this means that it doesn't account, for instance, if there is any air on the rectum, which would modify the dose distribution, these dose distributions would not be modified, would had an impact on the coverage or those organs at risk that we wouldn't solve with this margin approaches.\", 'Another way to go on, is with a robust optimization and robust evaluation.', 'This is a modern approach where it is much more sophisticated and takes the uncertainties explicitly into account.', \"So, if they into, we look at different scenarios, so we have different presences, different cities, different communities, and then we take into consideration all these possibilities of that patient, that concrete patient, and this will solve, this solves the Margin approach, because basically we stop using Margins and we'll look at this probabilistic planning to make this plan robust.\", 'Another way for instance, interesting to make the plan for instance a breast plan robust, is the use of virtual bolus So we force the treatment planning system to deliver a homogeneous fluence outside the body to account for the fact that with the breathing, the patient will move the breasts, and we need this breast still to be inside the dose distribution.', 'This static dose distribution we are referring to.', 'By doing that, by doing VMAT with this virtual bolus we are ensuring that this plan will... the CTV will be cover, whatever the breathing place of the patient is.', 'This was done on 3D conformer.', \"So, if you are a studio in 3D conformer for the breast you know that usually you open the beam that it goes, it's not matching the surface of the CT of the breasts on the CT, but you open it a little bit more to account for that.\", 'And you have to take this also into account when you are doing VMAT planning.', 'This is some images on how you do that.', \"Let's move now to the plan complexity.\", 'And the plan complexity basically looks at the characteristics of the plan from a mechanical point of view that make the plan difficult to be deliver by the treatment machine.', 'And also put some challenges to the treatment planning system, calculation accuracy.', 'And basically, these are the aperture size and irregularity, and also the speed of the gantry and dose rate.', 'So why is this plan complexity important?', 'Because the calculation uncertainties will depend on plan complexity.', \"For instance, one thing that is a lot, well, for the physicists, but you know that the MSC, how they are built, they have what we call tongue-and-groove so that the lips move like this, and there is, in order to avoid having a leakage there's kind of a small step that makes the leaves move this way.\", \"So, and this small step that is made because we don't want to have leakage has to be modelled in the treatment planning system and for most planning system, the model of this phenomenon demency, it's not perfect.\", 'It means that we will have a lot of tongue-and-groove.', 'So, this small step going in and out of the beam.', 'This can impact our, dose calculation uncertainties so that dose calculations will be not as accurate as we think, also the small fields, present challenges in the dose calculation, and also then the delivery uncertainties.', 'So, the delivery uncertainties depend on the plan complexity.', 'And then the physicist commonly says, okay, I do quality verification.', 'So, what are you telling me, so I am getting excellent results with high complex plans, but anyway, reducing these uncertainties is still important because we want to deliver the desired dose distribution to the patient?', 'So having this under control is important.', \"So, let's get the best plan we can with the lower complexity and the higher robustness.\", \"So, and it's what I was telling.\", 'So, a highly complex plan involves smaller and more irregular MLC apertures larger tongue-and-groove effects, higher modulation of dynamic parameters, higher monitoring units and more intra fraction movements and interplay effects.', 'So, in summary, plans with low complexity have less uncertainties, and we have more accurate dose calculations in the treatment planning system, and better accuracy and robustness in treatment delivery.', 'So, this we could look at, for instance, this would be the plan quality, plan score on the plan irregularity.', 'We would think that, okay, increase the plan regularity, which is a complexity score, will means that we will have a better dose distribution, but you see that this is not the case.', 'So, this is different centres.', 'We deliver the same case, they use the same VMAT, the same TPS, similar linacs and you can see how different centres even having a very high plan score.', 'The plan is score is based on the dose distribution, on the achievement of the dose constraints.', 'And the dose objectives set by the radiation oncologist.', 'You can see that very high plan score.', 'They have a complete range of different plan irregularities, which is one of the complexity scores.', 'Okay?', 'So probably this are unnecessarily complex plans.', 'And these would be the optimal plans.', 'So, a low plan irregularity with a very high plan score regarding the achievement of dose constraints and dose objectives in the PTVs.', 'And this will be sub-optimal plans.', \"And these would be worse plans because they don't reach this plan score and they have somehow a high plane irregularity.\", 'So, in summary, treatment plan quality depends on the calculated dose distribution.', \"And remember, this is a nominal scenario, but it's not the dose that you will deliver to the patient.\", 'And here as a radiation oncologist.', 'You have to be very conscious that sometimes because you want to push down the dose to the rectum, then you will have a fluency.', 'We look at the plan slide by slide.', 'You may find that you have a very high dose, very near the rectum, because we are pushing the fluence out of the rectum.', 'The dose has to be somewhere.', 'And it means that this plan will be very...', \"The robustness will not be very good because if the rectum moves this 105% that you have been near the rectum, but you don't see in the dose-volume histogram, it may go down to the rectum on the 3rd/ 4th fraction.\", 'And robustness.', 'So, look at the geometric anatomic uncertainties and then the complexity, the uncertainties in the dose calculations, and emitted fluence and you have to have these three things on your mind when you are looking at one plan So how do I see a treatment plan, treatment planning in some years from now?', 'So basically, what I would like to see is that we have a patient data form, from the radiation oncologist, we would have for that patient, that particular patient, with that characteristics, a predictive model, so that we could have a personalized NTCP, that will drive us to a personalized, dose- volume histogram constraints.', 'Or I would rather look at kind of the dose distribution 3D kind of type of constraints.', 'And we could have some personalized optimization goals that then we can compare with the treatment planning.', 'And this basically has to go through, I would say, AI may help us, do that, but we have to be conscious of one thing.', 'So, when we work on the night, we can have the 3D, doses distribution, all the boxes, these type of approaches that have been done by the group of Marcel van Herk and Laura Cella.', \"But please keep in mind that one model doesn't last forever.\", 'So, you have to fit the model again and again, every time you are changing techniques, the patients also change, the basic characteristic change.', 'So, all these has to be fit to the model in order to get it retrain.', 'And with that, I would like to thank some of my colleagues that have helped me for many years on, on discussions on plan quality.', 'Victor, Jordi and Diego and I am open for any questions you may have.', 'Thank you for your attention.', 'So, thank you very much.', 'Thank you, Nuria, for this excellent talk, very inspiring, I would say.', 'And so, we will be more than happy of course, to receive your comments and questions.', 'So, I mean, feel free to do that.', \"So Nuria, I think I took some notes while you were talking, and there's some like several points that I would want to address.\", 'So, you nicely saw that, whenever evaluating the quality of a treatment plan, we need to deal with complexity, and complexity is one of the issue that you address, but it would say like generally speaking, the topic is complicated.', 'I would say and is articulated.', 'And sometimes we, as radiation oncology as clinician, tend to underestimate the different characteristics that we would need to focus on to be able to judge properly a treatment plan.', 'So, some of the topic that you address are quite important.', \"So, the let's say limitation of the DVH.\", \"So, let's say, let's focus on calculated dose distribution.\", \"We tend to focus on DVH, DVH has a limit, probably the surface histograms are, better, and probably to have a better anatomical let's say representation of the dose distribution, we need to go for dose maps.\", 'I would say.', 'Some of the points that you touch on are very important.', 'So, for example, the way we delineate an organ at risk is crucial.', 'Of course, there is no consensus.', 'There are some initiatives that are trying to reach a consensus.', 'Some are national, some are international.', \"And, but we really need to know when, whenever we, let's say also evaluated clinical result and comparing clinical results.\", 'And particularly when we compare toxicity of the treatment, sometimes we really are talking about different things because the organ at risk has been delineated in a different way.', \"And so sometimes it's hard to compare the results.\", \"So of course, an effort in terms of harmonization, I think it's very, it will be very important.\", 'Then the problem of end points, right?', 'Because whenever we use dose constraint or dose objectives, then we need to set up some endpoints.', 'And the priority of the endpoints could be different.', \"And it's normally it's chosen by the, the doctor, let's say the physician or by the clinician, or by the team treating the patient and not by the patient.\", 'And sometimes the endpoints could be very different depending on the patient you are treating, and this is not taking into account.', 'And the other point is the plan quality you get from a medical physicist depends probably on the number of iterations, right?', \"So, when you treated complexity, you say, you don't need to go for unnecessarily complicated and complex plan, you should stay on the optimal plan, but sometimes plans are kind of too, let say basic, right?\", \"You do some number of iterations, then you reach your objectives, but probably by doing more iteration, you could still go and reduce the, let's say the deep, I mean, I have a better DVH in that, so probably sometimes automation could help.\", 'So, I would maybe want to have your opinion on the end points, the problem of endpoints, the problem of our harmonisation of counters, but also the, probably the issue of automation and how to probably improve the way we plan.', 'Yeah, definitely.', 'So, we have gone through that.', 'So, we have this in our institution.', 'We have nine dosimetrists, and we are six physicists on radiation oncology, clinical physicist.', 'And basically, what we found for instance, in prostate and rectum, where we have gone through automation was that depending on who was taking the dosimetry basically the plan you were going through more iterations than somebody else.', 'So basically, you could improve, you could push that histogram.', 'So that, has been kind of standardized now with two things.', 'First, on being very insisting, a lot on the radiation oncologist on the contouring the rectum, we have a peer review session looking at the contours every morning on all the patients.', \"So, we have with some consensus, that's very important when you are also trying to automate treatment planning.\", 'So, you have to have things quite a standardized from also from the contouring point of view.', 'And then now with the automation, we have been enable first to, to kind of get a very good dose-volume histogram, regarding organs at risk without losing a coverage of our PTVs, but also keeping the complexity under some three scores.', \"So basically, when we don't when we were training our model, we have rapid plan.\", 'We were taking plans that we knew that the complexity scores were reasonable.', 'So, we were going through... we have an independent program because this, unfortunately, is not implemented in full, I would say in most, of the blind systems, by the way, we knew that dose treatment plans had gone through the metrics for plan complexity.', 'What is more difficult for us to do is looking at the plan robustness.', \"So, the plan robustness, is something that really, I think it's very... it's a clinical issue in something because the plan complexity are some metrics that physicist do, and we keep them under control, you know, Professor Franco.\", 'But the thing is that the, the plan robustness is something that the clinicians have to be used to look at the dose distribution.', \"If you're using kind of a coloured wash, put 100, 106 and look where this dose are.\", 'For instance, for a prostate, look if they are very near the rectum, because it means that probably the dose optimization has been pushed a lot to get the dose out of the rectum, but you have a dose distribution that is not very robust to the position of rectum.', 'If you have slight movement in these 105, 110 or seven can fall into the rectum.', 'The same for head and neck.', 'So, for head and neck is another good example.', 'So, you can, for instance, we can push the 40 Gy ISO line.', 'ISO dose, out of the spinal cord.', \"And I can make our next, dose-volumes histogram, because it's almost there, but it's not touching the spinal cord, but it's too near.\", \"So, to have this idea of that, you have some points that really, really, or for instance, you have some maximums near the spinal cord, that small movement means that you can't have the 107 inside something that has to be looked, and you can only see that by looking at the dose's distribution.\", \"And we still don't have the tools in the premium planning systems, but we will never have the tools if the professionals don't ask for them.\", \"That's my message.\", 'So basically, if we don\\'t go to the vendors and say, \" hey, I know, this role was planning.', 'I want also for, for photons.', 'I want to be sure that my plan is robust to movements.', 'I want to do provide basic planning importance also because this will...\"', 'I am a believer.', 'I would say that this will make a high impact for the patients, because the more robust is a plan, the most consistent is to have the treatment.', 'And then when we started looking at the toxicity, you have said there are several standardization of volumes, also look in at the, the robustness of the plan.', 'These two things are very important in order to fit, our predictive models and make them kind of meaningful.', 'Yeah, reliable.', 'Yeah.', 'This is what it is.', 'True, true.', 'And Nuria, do you think, you touched upon robustness.', 'Do you think that the new approaches that are now being used of like a daily re optimization that can be done, of course, with new machine MR-based, or cone beam CT-based, would change the approach, because like, theoretically, at least, I mean, the inter-fraction variation should be taken into account, then, of course, the intra fraction variation could still exist, need to be managed and mitigated, but you think it will change, or...', 'I think, I think, yes, the problem here, I am sure that for the patient, it would be better.', 'The problem here is that we are not there yet regarding how we estimate the dose that the patient receives when we are doing adaptive.', 'So basically, the dose accumulation in adaptive with the formations.', \"It's a very difficult and non-solved problem.\", 'You can imagine, for instance, a very clear example is a lung tumour, that is reducing its size.', 'So, you put that up at that point, but then you, you may have this, or, head and neck tumour, even better.', 'So, you have a head and neck tumour near the skin and the treatment is working and you get a reduction of this tumour.', 'So how will you accumulate the dose there?', 'Because the tumour is not there.', 'So how you, deform, these tissues to know which is, the real dose that has received.', \"So, it's a basic thing because the mass, the doses is joules per kilogram.\", 'And if the mass is not there, how do you solve this issue?', 'So, there are things have been discussed, but these dose accumulations, in order to make a, to tell the radiation oncologists this patient has received this dose, or this is the final dose-volume histogram is not that easy when we are doing adaptive, even though I am sure that for the patient is the best.', 'So, at maximum, I can tell you, okay, I am sure that it has not gone through this dose in the, into the rectum, but the concept that you have now with dose-volume histograms, of dose distributions has to be re-thought.', 'And still there a lot of discussions on going in the physics community, how to make these dose accumulations.', 'Yeah, more...', 'Accurate, meaningful.', 'So, we can look at that, I can do it, but think about it, if something disappears, how, how do you trace that dose?', 'Yeah.', \"If a voxel is there and now it's no more, they are, then how can we manage that?\", \"That's true.\", 'Nuria, We can...', \"I think we are about to close because we are a bit overtime, but maybe just the final consideration, if you want, we talk about plan quality and plan quality, I think it's just a small part of quality, in radiotherapy.\", 'And I mean, you know, I know that you, of course are an expert also in, assessing quality, generally speaking in radiotherapy, you want to make like a final remark about how quality is important to assess quality not only for plans, but I mean, in the general process of radiotherapy for, in general being able to deliver a good patient care in cancer care.', 'Oh, for sure.', 'So, basically what it has been shown, and we are aware of clinical trials that they have looked at.', 'That the quality in the complete process of radiotherapy has a huge impact on the patient outcomes.', 'So, all the small steps have to be under control in a way in order to achieve a good result.', 'And this can be achieved in all the team plays together.', 'So, all the specialties, radiation oncologists, medical physicists, RTTs.', 'I mean, its people are the administration to keep track on the timing of the patients.', 'So, you can have a perfect plan, but maybe the patient cannot start after two months.', 'So, what does it mean to have a perfect plan quality if the patient cannot start?', 'So, these small things of keeping this under control are still important.', 'And one good recommendation is never, to be afraid to go through a clinical audits from external people.', \"It is an excellent exercise, and it's something that will come in Europe by, by the new BSS.\", 'So how we can do clinical audits.', \"We can use this as an opportunity to improve all the patient outcomes, or we kind of use it as let's do something so that we can sign and we are with, within the law.\", \"And I would like to encourage people listening that it's an excellent opportunity to push the governments, to push the structures of societies to work on how to structure, this clinical audits in a minimal, meaningful way so that we can improve the quality of all treatments for all patients.\", 'Right.', 'Right.', \"That's a very good final message.\", 'So, thank you.', 'Thank you very much Nuria.', 'So, thank you again for the very insightful and interesting talk and very educational and thank you everyone for joining.', 'Thank you for inviting me.', 'It has been a pleasure.', 'Thank you everyone, have a good night.', 'Bye-bye.']\n",
            "['Hola a todos.', 'Es un placer estar aquí, y haber sido invitada por el profesor Franco, para compartir con ustedes mi experiencia en la evaluación de los planes de tratamiento en radioterapia.', 'Soy Nuria Jornet, soy Física Médica Consultora, Jefe Clínica de Física Radioterápica, en el Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, de Barcelona.', 'Y bien, los objetivos de aprendizaje de esta ponencia serán proporcionarles una visión general del proceso de tratamiento con radioterapia.', 'Analizaremos los diferentes ángulos de la calidad del plan de tratamiento, porque al final de esta sesión, me gustaría que pudieran hacer una evaluación crítica de la calidad del plan siempre que se enfrenten a un plan de tratamiento elaborado por el físico médico.', 'Y también, porque es muy importante si tienes que diseñar pautas de radioterapia para ensayos clínicos, y también para protocolos internos de tratamiento.', 'Entonces, ¿qué implica el tratamiento de radioterapia?', 'Básicamente, vamos a tener un paciente en nuestro departamento, y el radiooncólogo decidirá si se va a tratar, y en este caso, él prescribirá el tratamiento.', 'Luego se someterá a algunas pruebas de diagnóstico por la imagen, por lo general mediante TAC.', 'Y de esas imágenes el radiooncólogo delineará los volúmenes que quieren tratar y los volúmenes que quieren proteger.', 'Toda esta información irá al departamento de física, que trabajarán en sus ordenadores para elaborar un plan de tratamiento, para conseguir la prescripción de tratamiento del radiooncólogo.', 'Y aquí realizaremos la mayor parte de nuestra evaluación del plan.', 'No obstante, sabemos que este plan se administrará al paciente en diferentes fracciones.', 'El paciente acudirá, en distintos días, al tratamiento, al departamento de radioterapia, irá a la unidad de tratamiento, y nosotros le administraremos el tratamiento.', 'Entonces, lo que deberíamos preguntarnos es si este tratamiento que se está administrando, concuerda con el tratamiento que estaba planeado, y por lo tanto con la prescripción de tratamiento del radiooncólogo.', 'Así que, tras las bambalinas para que esto suceda, para que podamos tener un tratamiento, que es el que el radiooncólogo prescribió, nosotros estamos haciendo, los físicos, básicamente estamos haciendo control de calidad de las máquinas para garantizar que todo funciona bien.', 'También estamos haciendo control de calidad del sistema de planificación del tratamiento; tenemos una prueba estándar para eso.', 'Pero luego tenemos al paciente, las imágenes, la planificación del tratamiento.', 'Y esta parte de aquí, incluso si tenemos esto bajo control, sabemos que el paciente también puede cambiar algo en el tratamiento, por ejemplo, o que la máquina, el día del tratamiento, puede no estar funcionando tan bien con nuestras pruebas de control de calidad.', 'Entonces, ¿qué es la calidad del plan?', 'De hecho, la calidad del plan es la adecuación clínica de la distribución de la dosis administrada que se puede esperar de manera realista de un plan de tratamiento.', 'Entonces, calcularemos la dosis en las imágenes del paciente.', 'Y luego tendremos una evaluación de la dosis administrada, teniendo en cuenta la prescripción, y también el volumen que ha sido delineado por el paciente.', 'He dicho aquí «esperada de manera realista», y es básicamente porque, tenemos que tener en cuenta las incertidumbres a las que nos enfrentamos cuando calculamos la distribución de la dosis, pero también cuando administramos la distribución de la dosis a un paciente en particular, diferentes fracciones.', 'Entonces, ¿cuáles son las aportaciones de las que proceden estas incertidumbres?', 'Básicamente, tenemos diferentes aportaciones, tenemos aportaciones que pertenecen al propio sistema de planificación de tratamientos.', 'Tenemos lo que llamamos el modelo de Haz.', 'Además, tenemos cómo se calcula esta dosis dentro del paciente de tratamiento.', 'También tenemos el modelo de Paciente.', 'Por lo tanto, suponemos que el paciente, cuando tenemos las imágenes de TAC y conocemos las densidades, y usaremos esto combinado con esto para obtener la distribución final de la dosis.', 'Y luego tenemos el plan de tratamiento.', 'Por lo tanto, esto nos proporcionará la distribución de la dosis según sea evaluada y aprobada por el radiooncólogo.', 'Por otro lado, tenemos el tratamiento.', 'Y en el tratamiento, tenemos que considerar que tenemos el LINAC, o la unidad de tratamiento.', 'Tenemos al paciente, el paciente real que viene para ser tratado.', 'Y luego tenemos el plan de tratamiento.', 'Y esto dará la distribución de la dosis administrada.', 'De nuevo, si queremos evaluar la distribución de la dosis administrada, tendremos que medirla de alguna manera, así que aquí tendremos también algunas incertidumbres.', 'Y compararemos estas dos cosas.', 'Y comparando estas dos cosas, diremos: «Bueno, el tratamiento se administró como estaba previsto, y como estaba prescrito».', 'Como pueden ver, todo esto es muy complejo, y por lo tanto tenemos muchas incertidumbres que debemos tener en cuenta.', 'La base de esta ponencia se encuentra en este artículo.', 'Hubo un taller organizado por el Comité de Física en ESTRO, para debatir entre los expertos, qué era la calidad del plan en radioterapia, y también cómo deberíamos evaluar la calidad del plan, qué parámetros deberíamos usar.', 'E introducimos, verán, que la calidad del plan no solo depende de la distribución de dosis calculada, sino que también, tenemos que tener en cuenta la robustez y también la complejidad del plan.', 'Y lo que haremos durante esta ponencia es fijarnos en estos tres componentes y entender mejor qué significan.', 'Por lo tanto, el mensaje importante aquí es que la calidad del plan no tiene que ver solo con la distribución de la dosis planificada.', 'Básicamente, hay que verlo desde diferentes ángulos para tener una idea completa de cómo se administrará el plan al final.', 'Así que, de nuevo, si vemos el plan de tratamiento, tenemos al paciente aquí, verán que este paciente tiene un poco de sobrepeso, eso es una cosa que hay que ver, porque el paciente de la sesión viene de manera diferente.', 'Esto es algo que puede suceder.', 'Pero de todos modos, tienen al paciente, pasarán por la TAC de planificación, tendrán el modelo del paciente, el radiooncólogo diseñará los volúmenes, prescribirá la dosis.', 'Y luego continuaremos con la planificación del tratamiento.', 'Y le proporcionaremos a radiooncología una distribución de la dosis, que se verá enormemente afectada por la exactitud de nuestros algoritmos de cálculo de la dosis.', 'Esto es algo que los físicos saben, y los radiooncólogos confían, a lo que se aferran, porque confían en nosotros, en que es exacto.', 'Pero hay diferentes incertidumbres.', 'Luego transferiremos todos los datos a nuestra unidad de tratamiento y el paciente acudirá para la administración del tratamiento.', 'Y pueden ver que el paciente viene varias veces.', 'Entonces, tenemos que tener en cuenta la administrabilidad del plan, lo que significa, ¿este plan que elaboramos en nuestro sistema de planificación del tratamiento, está siendo bien administrado por nuestra unidad de tratamiento?', '¿Puede la unidad de tratamiento tener algunas limitaciones que significan que este plan no se administra exactamente como lo pensamos?', 'Velocidades del túnel, velocidades del multiláminas, este tipo de cosas.', 'Y también, debemos tener en cuenta eso muy bien porque hoy en día todos estamos haciendo estudios de imagen a bordo, o la mayoría de nosotros, sabemos que el paciente puede cambiar de una fracción a la otra.', 'Por lo tanto, tenemos que tener en cuenta también la irradiación del paciente, y para hacerlo, tenemos que garantizar que este plan es robusto.', 'Por lo tanto, tiene que ser robusto para las variaciones de los pacientes, y también para la administración del tratamiento.', 'Y esto es muy popular ahora con los protones, porque tenemos, sabemos que el rango se ve muy afectado por las variaciones del paciente.', 'Y todo el mundo escucha o ve en las publicaciones sobre la robustez planificada, pero es un concepto que puede ser... también se debe aplicar a nuestros tratamientos estándar utilizando protones o electrones.', 'Recuerden que pueden enviar preguntas al chat, y el profesor Franco se encargará de ellas.', 'Así que empecemos, empecemos con la distribución de la dosis calculada.', 'Es lo que normalmente usamos para evaluar un plan.', 'Veamos este caso.', 'Por lo general, lo que hacemos es ir corte por corte, o esto es lo que deberíamos hacer.', 'Nos fijamos en la distribución de las dosis.', 'Este sería el mejor método de evaluación, ver la distribución de la dosis, pero hay que tener mucho cuidado con cómo, usamos las diferentes líneas de isodosis o las diferentes herramientas que tiene el sistema de planificación del tratamiento para mostrar que esta distribución es corte por corte.', 'Aquí pueden ver, por ejemplo, todas las curvas de isodosis.', 'Se puede usar el relleno de color con diferentes etiquetas, pero hay otras cosas que se pueden ver.', 'Se pueden ver los perfiles a través de diferentes estructuras.', 'Se pueden ver las dosis puntuales, las superficies de isodosis, etc. pero es importante tener cuidado con la visualización, por ejemplo, algunos de nuestros, cuando el dosimetrista llega a nuestro departamento y vienen de otro departamento, a veces solo resaltan línea de isodosis del 95%, 105% y algo así como 107%, pero faltan todas los demás.', 'Entonces, es algo que deberíamos considerar.', 'Así que tengan cuidado cuando vean esto.', 'De nuevo, si siguen este camino, miran todos estos cortes, obtienen la distribución de dosis 3D, pueden tener muchos cortes, tienen muchos vóxeles.', 'Tienes una gran cantidad de información.', 'Existe una relación compleja entre dosis-anatomía y respuesta clínica.', 'Es muy difícil de cuantificar, tan difícil de evaluar el impacto clínico.', 'Así que tendrán una idea de cómo es esta distribución, pero normalmente lo que hacen los oncólogos tradicionales, es mirar los histogramas de dosis-volumen que es una especie de resumen, o compacta toda esta información en un histograma, el número de cajas, prescriben una determinada dosis.', 'Y esto es lo que habitualmente haríamos, lo que el radiooncólogo miraría, y es lo que usamos para optimizar el plan de tratamiento, hoy en día.', 'Hablemos un poco de los histogramas de dosis-volumen, que es lo que llamo el Santo Grial.', 'Y me gustaría ser de alguna manera crítica con ellos, al menos para hacerles pensar lo que realmente representan y lo que realmente no representan.', '¿Por qué usamos histogramas de dosis-volumen?', 'Usamos histogramas de dosis-volumen porque hace muchos años, nosotros...', 'Hubo una publicación en el Red Journal de QUANTEC, donde la toxicidad de nuestros tratamientos se correlacionaba con estos, algunos puntos en el histograma de dosis-volumen.', 'Este es el caso de la próstata, y pueden ver que compactaron, reunieron información de diferentes grupos, que trataban la próstata, y buscaron los límites de dosis para toxicidad rectal grado 2.', 'Y pueden ver, por ejemplo, estas líneas, que muestran que hay bastante acuerdo con todos los grupos que para dosis altas que tienen, por ejemplo, que el volumen que recibe el 70%...', '70 Gy debe ser menos del 20% del volumen, de lo contrario había un riesgo alto, de tener toxicidad rectal de grado dos.', 'Pero para esta publicación, la mayoría de los parámetros del modelo se basaron en pacientes tratados principalmente sin IMRT, o localización diaria, así que no están haciendo IGRT.', 'Y la mayoría de los estudios usaron fracciones de 1,8 o 2 Gy.', 'Entonces, a partir de estos estudios, y de nuevo, poniendo el ejemplo de la próstata y el recto, nosotros, la comunidad acordamos algunas restricciones en el histograma de dosis-volumen.', 'Y aquí pueden ver las restricciones del histograma de dosis-volumen para la toxicidad rectal, y hay diferentes puntos en ese histograma de dosis-volumen.', 'Esto fue revisado hace algunos años por Caroline Olsson, y en 2018 y se ve que también para, para tratamientos de cáncer de próstata, revisaron estas restricciones en el histograma de dosis-volumen y se incluyeron nuevas técnicas, con todos los casos que se incluyeron, cuando se usa IGRT.', 'Fue con dosis nominales máximas, un poco más altas, porque hemos ido aumentando la dosis en la próstata debido a los avances en tecnología, y con fracciones de dosis, de 1,8 a 3, así que aún sin incluir tratamientos de SBRT, tratamientos focales, o protones, y ven que esto ha sido revisado de vez en cuando.', 'Pero lo que es importante que entiendan es que este histograma de dosis-volumen, aunque es una herramienta muy buena porque compacta información, es una especie de red de seguridad, la usamos para optimización.', 'Los histogramas dosis-volumen pierden, información espacial.', 'Básicamente, si este es el recto, y tienen estos puntos de dosis altas aquí y ahí, o las tienen concentradas en una región, el histograma de dosis-volumen se verá exactamente igual, así que están perdiendo esta información espacial.', 'Y hay evidencias, evidencias antiguas, de que la distribución espacial de estas dosis altas realmente es importante.', 'Hay datos en animales de los estudios de Trott en 1995, que muestran que el daño de la radiación del colon en ratas depende del tamaño y la forma de la superficie irradiada.', 'En los datos en humanos, sin embargo, no se han recogido estas, digamos, distribuciones topográficas de dosis, básicamente porque ahora tenemos la potencia informática para, de alguna manera, almacenar todos estos datos, pero antes no la teníamos.', 'Otra cosa importante en el histograma de dosis-volumen, es que como normalmente usamos el porcentaje de volumen dependiendo del recto total que delimitamos, entonces el porcentaje de volumen cambiará, por lo que depende de cómo se normalice.', 'Entonces, es algo que uno tiene que considerar cuando se comparan estudios, uno tiene que ser muy cuidadoso de la tierra, por ejemplo, del recto que se está delimitando, de otra manera uno podría tener problemas, básicamente porque estaría comparando, con las recomendaciones sobre el volumen que recibe una determinada dosis, pero estaría con un tipo diferente de volumen porcentual.', 'Otra cosa en los histogramas de dosis-volumen, y por ejemplo, la vejiga y el recto es la pregunta de si podría ser más relevante un histograma de dosis-superficie que un histograma de volumen, y había bastante interés en esto hace muchos años, así que tenemos un puñado de publicaciones de físicos muy famosos que trabajaban en este tipo de histogramas de dosis-superficie de los años 2000-2005.', 'Pero en ese momento, la radioterapia conformada 3D era el tratamiento de referencia, y no encontraron muchas diferencias, mientras si comparaban las métricas del histograma de dosis-volumen en función de volúmenes o superficie, pero esto era porque básicamente en ese momento, usábamos este tipo de tratamientos, que empleaban un proceso de planificación de tratamiento basado en el tratamiento de cajas de cuatro campos.', 'Nuestra distribución de dosis era muy, muy similar y los histogramas de dosis-volumen, aunque perdieran, información espacial, descrita de forma similar, distribuciones de dosis que en el fondo eran muy, muy similares, había una correlación entre el histograma de dosis-volumen y la distribución de dosis en 3D porque estábamos haciendo más o menos lo mismo.', '¿Qué pasa ahora?', 'Ahora tenemos modulación, IMRT y VMAT, tenemos diferentes técnicas, y luego podemos tener dos histogramas que ocultan, distribuciones de dosis 3D completamente diferentes en el fondo.', 'Así que hice este ejercicio, esto es una próstata y jugué con ella.', 'Hice esta especie de rejilla aquí y todos estos histogramas de dosis-volumen, ellos, puedo comparar, los histogramas de dosis-volumen, pero lo que hay detrás de ellos es una distribución de dosis completamente diferente.', 'Por lo tanto, en este momento, esta buena correlación entre la métrica del histograma de dosis-volumen y la distribución de la dosis 3D ya no es verdad.', 'Así pues, el mensaje aquí, es básicamente que tal vez es el momento de pensar en mejores métricas para describir la distribución de la dosis de manera que podamos correlacionarlas mejor, la distribución de la dosis con la toxicidad.', 'Y solo para mostrarles una parte del trabajo que se está haciendo en este sentido, aquí pueden ver cómo estamos revisando de nuevo, estos histogramas de dosis-superficie, y no solo eso, sino también observando dónde se concentran estas dosis altas en la superficie del recto y viendo si esto se correlaciona con diferentes tipos de toxicidades.', 'En este estudio se encontraron relaciones significativas en el tenesmo rectal y la incontinencia fecal explicadas por las altas dosis en la parte central y superior del recto, y también las dificultades de vaciado que se explicaban por las extensiones longitudinales de las dosis intermedias.', 'Este es otro estudio de VoxTox en 2015 también, y aquí se fijan en la distribución de la dosis administrada haciendo el mismo ejercicio.', 'Es decir, mirando la distribución de estas dosis altas en la superficie rectal y correlacionándolas con la toxicidad que encontraron.', \"Otros estudios, que son muy potentes y están siendo realizados por colegas italianos, por Laura Cella y Marcel van Herk, en el Christie's en Manchester, realmente se están fijando en la distribución de las dosis con las cajas y buscando si las cajas con posición de dosis altas se correlacionan con la toxicidad, y lo han hecho para los tratamientos de corazón y pulmón, y esto está dando datos muy potentes para entender mejor dónde están los problemas, cuando miramos la toxicidad y no miramos solo un punto en el histograma de dosis-volumen.\", 'Entonces, y esto podría ser, cómo evaluamos la distribución de la dosis calculada, pero ahora hablemos un poco de la robustez.', 'Y la robustez está relacionada con la pregunta de si estamos seguros al 100% de que las métricas del histograma de dosis-volumen coinciden con lo que recibe el paciente.', 'Esto es otra cosa.', 'Básicamente, en todos los estudios que he mostrado, se fijaban en la distribución de la dosis en el plan, y se fijaban en la toxicidad, pero puede haber una brecha entre lo que pensamos, lo que planeamos, y lo que el paciente recibe.', 'Y ahora vamos a fijarnos en esto.', 'Y básicamente, este es el proceso en, con respecto a un control de calidad de un paciente específico, y ahora nos centraremos en esta parte aquí, así que en la IGRT.', 'Ahora tenemos una herramienta muy poderosa para verificar lo que estamos haciendo.', 'Una es la IGRT, es decir, tomar imágenes antes del tratamiento, durante el tratamiento con el paciente en la camilla, cada fracción.', 'Y también podemos incorporar aquí la dosimetría _in vivo_ midiendo o evaluando la dosis durante el tratamiento.', 'Esto es también del estudio VoxTox del que estábamos hablando, y aquí están nuestros 10 pacientes de próstata.', 'Y pueden ver que cada paciente tiene un color, y esta es la diferencia de dosis, ¿de acuerdo?, en Gy, respecto al volumen del recto para cada fracción diferente.', 'Y pueden ver que para el recto, pueden tener diferencias para un paciente de hasta el 20% de la dosis.', 'No, 20 Gy.', 'No, 20%...', 'Yo diría, porcentaje.', 'Pero bueno, se puede ver que para algunos pacientes va bastante bien, para los pacientes hay una diferencia.', 'Si miran la isolínea de 40 Gy, pueden ver que puede haber una diferencia en el volumen porcentual del 40%.', 'Entonces, en este asunto, aquí hay otro estudio también del 2010, y pueden ver cómo el recto cambia de una fracción a otra, y esto tiene un gran impacto para algunos pacientes en la distribución del histograma de dosis-volumen.', 'Estos grupos también vieron que las correlaciones con la hemorragia rectal y la proctitis se lograron, fueron más fuertes, si tenemos en cuenta la dosis administrada y no la dosis planeada, que es algo que si lo piensan, es bastante obvio porque es lo que el paciente ha recibido realmente.', 'La cosa es que deberíamos tratar de igualar lo más posible, la distribución de dosis que hemos planeado con la distribución de dosis que estamos administrando, o deberíamos calcular lo que el paciente ha recibido para usar esta información, para guiar los modelos de toxicidad, por ejemplo.', 'Y así es como podríamos actuar. Entonces, lo que les decía era que o bien calculamos las métricas de la dosis administrada, o tratamos de que la dosis administrada coincida lo más posible con la dosis planeada.', '¿Cómo podemos hacerlo?', 'Con las instrucciones del paciente, preparación...', 'De manera que haya mucha coherencia entre la planificación y la administración, usar la IGRT, orientación mediante imágenes con TAC de haz cónico o resonancia magnética, ver los registros sustitutos.', 'Entonces, esto es muy importante.', 'Entrenar a los técnicos de radioterapia en las unidades de tratamiento, cómo deberían ajustar y cómo deberían evaluar estas imágenes de IGRT, podemos adaptar, podemos rastrear, o podemos hacer planes robustos o probabilísticos.', 'Aquí tenemos un resumen de dónde estamos ahora.', 'Entonces, nos fijamos en la dosis administrada al paciente, y podemos tener estas incertidumbres, que tienen un impacto aquí.', 'Así, la incertidumbre en la «fluencia emitida», el linac o la incertidumbre en los cálculos de dosis, la analizaremos después, que será la complejidad del plan.', 'Pero ahora nos fijamos básicamente en la incertidumbre geométrica con el paciente, la configuración del paciente los cambios o movimientos anatómicos y los cambios de densidad en el interior del paciente.', 'Y esto es lo que llamaríamos la robustez del plan.', 'Así, en un plan robusto, el CTV recibirá la dosis prescrita y los tejidos normales cumplirán las restricciones, a pesar de todas las incertidumbres que tenemos.', 'Por lo tanto, un buen plan de tratamiento debe tener una buena distribución de la dosis, pero también debe ser robusto ante esto, posibles diferencias en el tratamiento cotidiano del paciente.', '¿Cómo podemos hacer robusto un plan?', 'Hay un método que hemos estado usando durante años, que son los márgenes.', 'Por lo tanto, podemos usar márgenes tanto en el volumen clínico de tratamiento.', 'Y dirigimos el volumen de planificación del tratamiento para asegurarnos, de que incluso el CTV se mueve dentro del PTV, ya que estamos evaluando de manera homogénea, o nos aseguramos de que el PTV sea irradiado con la dosis prescrita, lo que significa que el CTV recibirá la dosis prescrita.', 'Y también podemos hacerlo con los órganos en riesgo, y definir los PRV, el volumen de riesgo de la planificación.', 'De todos modos, sabemos que el enfoque de los márgenes tiene varias limitaciones.', 'Una de las principales limitaciones es que básicamente presupone un cálculo de nubes de dosis estática, y esto significa que no tiene en cuenta, por ejemplo, si hay aire en el recto, lo que modificaría la distribución de la dosis, estas distribuciones de la dosis no se modificarían, tendrían un impacto en la cobertura o los órganos en riesgo que no resolveríamos con este enfoque de los márgenes.', 'Otra forma de actuar es con una optimización robusta y una evaluación robusta.', 'Se trata de un enfoque moderno en el que es mucho más sofisticado y tiene en cuenta explícitamente las incertidumbres.', 'Así que si ellos en, miramos diferentes escenarios, así tenemos diferentes presencias, diferentes ciudades, diferentes comunidades, y luego tomamos en consideración todas estas posibilidades de ese paciente, ese paciente concreto, y esto resolverá, esto resuelve el enfoque de los márgenes, porque básicamente dejamos de usar márgenes y miramos esta planificación probabilística para hacer este plan robusto.', 'Otra forma, por ejemplo, interesante de hacer el plan, por ejemplo un plan de la mama robusto, es el uso del bolo virtual. Así que forzamos el sistema de planificación de tratamiento a administrar una fluencia homogénea fuera del cuerpo para tener en cuenta el hecho de que con la respiración, la paciente moverá las mamas, y necesitamos que esta mama esté aún dentro de la distribución de dosis.', 'Esta es la distribución estática de la dosis a la que nos referimos.', 'Haciendo eso, haciendo VMAT con este bolo virtual nos aseguramos de que este plan... Se cubrirá el CTV, sea cual sea el lugar de respiración de la paciente.', 'Esto se hizo en un conformador 3D.', 'Así, si uno está en un estudio en conformador 3D para la mama se sabe que normalmente se abre el haz que va, no coincide con la superficie de la TAC de las mamas en la TAC, pero lo abre un poco más para tener esto en cuenta.', 'Y también hay que tener esto en cuenta cuando se planifica el VMAT.', 'Estas son algunas imágenes de cómo hacerlo.', 'Pasemos ahora a la complejidad del plan.', 'Y la complejidad del plan básicamente se fija en las características del plan desde un punto de vista mecánico que hacen que el plan sea difícil de administrar por la máquina de tratamiento.', 'Y también supone ciertos desafíos para el sistema de planificación de tratamientos, la exactitud de cálculo.', 'Y básicamente, estos son el tamaño y la irregularidad de la abertura, y también la velocidad del tubo y la tasa de dosis.', '¿Por qué es importante la complejidad del plan?', 'Porque las incertidumbres de cálculo dependerán de la complejidad del plan.', 'Por ejemplo, una cosa que es mucho, bueno, para los físicos, pero saben que el MSC, cómo están construidos, tienen lo que llamamos lengua y surco de manera que los labios se mueven así, y hay, para evitar una fuga, hay una especie de pequeño escalón que hace que las láminas se muevan de esta forma.', 'Entonces, este pequeño escalón que se hace porque no queremos tener fugas tiene que ser modelado en el sistema de planificación del tratamiento y para la mayoría del sistema de planificación, el modelo de esta demencia de fenómeno , no es perfecto.', 'Significa que tendremos mucho machihembrado.', 'Entonces, este pequeño escalón entra y sale del haz.', 'Esto puede repercutir en nuestras incertidumbres del cálculo de la dosis, de modo que los cálculos de la dosis no sean tan exactos como pensamos, también los campos pequeños, presentan retos en el cálculo de la dosis y también las incertidumbres de la administración.', 'Así pues, las incertidumbres de la administración dependen de la complejidad del plan.', 'Y entonces el físico normalmente dice, bueno, hago verificación de la calidad.', 'Entonces, qué me están diciendo, o sea, estoy obteniendo resultados excelentes con planes complejos altos, pero de todos modos, reducir estas incertidumbres sigue siendo importante porque queremos administrar la distribución de la dosis deseada al paciente.', 'Así que tener esto bajo control es importante.', 'Entonces, consigamos el mejor plan que podamos con la menor complejidad y la mayor robustez.', 'Y es lo que estaba diciendo.', 'Por lo tanto, un plan muy complejo implica aberturas más pequeñas y más irregulares del MLC, mayores efectos de machihembrado, una mayor modulación de los parámetros dinámicos, mayores unidades de monitorización y más movimientos intrafracciones y efectos de interacción.', 'Así, en resumen, los planes con baja complejidad tienen menos incertidumbres, y tenemos cálculos de dosis más exactos en el sistema de planificación de tratamientos, y mejor exactitud y robustez en la administración del tratamiento.', 'Así que podríamos ver, por ejemplo, esto sería la calidad del plan, la puntuación del plan en la irregularidad del plan.', 'Pensaríamos que, de acuerdo, aumentar la regularidad del plan, que es una puntuación de complejidad, significará que tendremos una mejor distribución de la dosis, pero ya ven que no es este el caso.', 'Estos son diferentes centros.', 'Entregamos el mismo caso, usan el mismo VMAT, el mismo TPS, linacs similares y pueden ver cómo diferentes centros incluso tienen una puntuación de los planes muy alta.', 'La puntuación del plan se basa en la distribución de la dosis, en el logro de las restricciones de la dosis.', 'Y los objetivos de dosis establecidos por el radiooncólogo.', 'Pueden ver esa puntuación del plan muy alta.', 'Tienen una completa gama de diferentes irregularidades del plan, que es una de las puntuaciones de la complejidad.', '¿De acuerdo?', 'Así que probablemente estos sean planes innecesariamente complejos.', 'Y estos serían los planes óptimos.', 'Por lo tanto, una baja irregularidad del plan con una puntuación muy alta del plan en cuanto al logro de restricciones de dosis y objetivos de dosis en los PTV.', 'Y estos serán planes sub-óptimos.', 'Y estos serían los peores planes porque no alcanzan esta puntuación del plan y tienen de alguna manera una alta irregularidad del plan.', 'Por lo tanto, en resumen, la calidad del plan de tratamiento depende de la distribución de la dosis calculada.', 'Y recuerden, este es un escenario nominal, pero no es la dosis que le administrarán al paciente.', 'Y aquí como radiooncólogo.', 'Debe ser muy consciente de que, a veces, porque quiere empujar la dosis hacia el recto, entonces tendrá una fluencia.', 'Vemos el plan diapositiva por diapositiva.', 'Puede que note que tiene una dosis muy alta, muy cerca del recto, porque estamos expulsando la fluencia del recto.', 'La dosis debe estar en algún lugar.', 'Y significa que este plan será muy...', 'La robustez no será muy buena porque si el recto mueve este 105% que usted ha estado cerca del recto, pero usted no lo ve en el histograma de dosis-volumen, puede descender hasta el recto en la 3.ª/4.ª fracción.', 'Y robustez.', 'Así que, observen las incertidumbres anatómicas geométricas y luego la complejidad, las incertidumbres en los cálculos de dosis, y la fluencia emitida y deben tener estas tres cosas en mente cuando se fijan en un plan. Entonces, ¿cómo veo un plan de tratamiento, la planificación del tratamiento dentro de algunos años?', 'Básicamente, lo que me gustaría ver es que tenemos un formulario de datos de pacientes, del radiooncólogo, que tendríamos para ese paciente, ese paciente en particular, con esas características, un modelo predictivo, para tener un NTCP personalizado, que nos llevará a restricciones personalizadas en el histograma de dosis-volumen.', 'O preferiría fijarme en, digamos, el tipo de restricciones de la distribución de la dosis 3D.', 'Y podríamos tener algunos objetivos de optimización personalizados que luego podemos comparar con la planificación del tratamiento.', 'Y esto básicamente tiene que ir a través, yo diría, la IA puede ayudarnos, a hacerlo, pero tenemos que ser conscientes de una cosa.', 'Así, cuando trabajamos en la noche, podemos tener la distribución de la dosis 3D, todas las cajas, este tipo de enfoques que ha hecho el grupo de Marcel van Herk y Laura Cella.', 'Pero tengan en cuenta que un modelo no dura para siempre.', 'Así que hay que ajustar el modelo una y otra vez, cada vez que se cambian las técnicas, los pacientes también cambian, el cambio de las características básicas.', 'Todo esto tiene que ajustarse al modelo para que se vuelva a entrenar.', 'Y con eso, me gustaría dar las gracias a algunos de mis colegas que me han ayudado durante muchos años en las discusiones sobre la calidad del plan.', 'Víctor, Jordi y Diego, y yo estoy abierta a cualquier pregunta que puedan tener.', 'Gracias por su atención.', 'Muchas gracias.', 'Gracias, Nuria, por esta excelente charla, muy inspiradora, diría.', 'Y por lo tanto, estamos más que encantados, por supuesto, de recibir sus comentarios y preguntas.', 'Es decir, siéntanse libres de hacerlo.', 'Así que Nuria, creo que tomé algunas notas mientras hablaba, y hay varios puntos que me gustaría abordar.', 'Bien vieron que, cuando se evalúa la calidad de un plan de tratamiento, tenemos que lidiar con la complejidad, y la complejidad es uno de los temas que abordan, pero yo diría que en términos generales, el tema es complicado.', 'En mi opinión y es articulado.', 'Y a veces nosotros, como radiooncólogos, como médicos, tendemos a subestimar las diferentes características en las que deberíamos centrarnos para poder juzgar adecuadamente un plan de tratamiento.', 'Por lo tanto, algunos de los temas que abordan son bastante importantes.', 'Entonces, digamos limitación del HDV.', 'Entonces, digamos, centrémonos en la distribución de la dosis calculada.', 'Tendemos a centrarnos en el HDV, el HDV tiene un límite, probablemente los histogramas de superficie son mejores, y probablemente para tener una mejor representación, digamos, anatómica de la distribución de la dosis, tenemos que optar por mapas de dosis.', 'En mi opinión.', 'Algunos de los puntos que toca son muy importantes.', 'Así, por ejemplo, la manera en que delineamos un órgano en riesgo es crucial.', 'Por supuesto, no existe consenso.', 'Hay algunas iniciativas que están tratando de alcanzar un consenso.', 'Algunas son nacionales, otras internacionales.', 'Y, pero realmente necesitamos saber cuándo, siempre que, digamos también evaluamos los resultados clínicos y comparamos los resultados clínicos.', 'Y especialmente cuando comparamos la toxicidad del tratamiento, a veces realmente estamos hablando de cosas diferentes porque el órgano en riesgo ha sido delineado de una manera diferente.', 'Y a veces es difícil comparar los resultados.', 'Por supuesto, un esfuerzo en términos de armonización, creo que es muy, será muy importante.', 'Entonces el problema de los criterios de valoración, ¿verdad?', 'Porque siempre que usamos restricciones de la dosis u objetivos de dosis, tenemos que establecer algunos criterios de valoración.', 'Y la prioridad de los criterios de valoración podría ser diferente.', 'Y normalmente es elegida por el, el médico, el médico, digamos el médico, o por el médico, o por el equipo que trata al paciente y no por el paciente.', 'Y a veces los criterios de valoración pueden ser muy diferentes dependiendo del paciente que esté tratando, y esto no se tiene en cuenta.', 'Y el otro punto es que la calidad del plan que obtienes de un físico médico depende probablemente de la cantidad de iteraciones, ¿no?', 'Entonces, cuando habló de la complejidad, dice, no necesitas ir a planes innecesariamente complicados y complejos, deberías permanecer en el plan óptimo, pero a veces los planes son también, digamos básicos, ¿no?', 'Se hacen algunas iteraciones, y luego se alcanzan los objetivos, pero probablemente al hacer más iteración, aún se podría ir y reducir la, digamos la profundidad, es decir, tengo un mejor HDV ahí, así que probablemente a veces la automatización podría ayudar.', 'Es decir, quizás me gustaría tener su opinión sobre los criterios de valoración, el problema de los criterios de valoración, el problema de nuestra armonización de los contadores, pero también, probablemente, el problema de la automatización y cómo mejorar probablemente la forma en que hacemos los planes.', 'Sí, sin duda.', 'Es decir, hemos pasado por eso.', 'Tenemos esto en nuestra institución.', 'Tenemos nueve dosimetristas, y somos seis físicos en radiooncología, físicos clínicos.', 'Y básicamente, lo que encontramos, por ejemplo, en próstata y recto, donde hemos pasado por la automatización fue que dependiendo de quién tomaba la dosimetría básicamente el plan, pasabas por más iteraciones que otra persona.', 'Así que, básicamente, podías mejorar, podías empujar ese histograma.', 'Eso ha sido, digamos, estandarizado ahora con dos cosas.', 'En primer lugar, siendo muy, insistiendo mucho en el radiooncólogo sobre el contorneado del recto, tenemos una sesión de revisión por pares observando los contornos cada mañana en todos los pacientes.', 'Así que, hemos llegado a un cierto consenso, eso es muy importante cuando también se está tratando de automatizar la planificación del tratamiento.', 'Así que hay que tener las cosas bastante estandarizadas también desde el punto de vista del contorneado.', 'Y ahora, con la automatización, hemos podido, primero, digamos, obtener un buen histograma de dosis-volumen, en relación con órganos en riesgo sin perder la cobertura de nuestros PTV, pero manteniendo la complejidad en unas tres puntuaciones.', 'Básicamente, cuando no, cuando estábamos entrenando nuestro modelo, tenemos un plan rápido.', 'Tomábamos planes que sabíamos que las puntuaciones de complejidad eran razonables.', 'Así que, pasamos por... tenemos un programa independiente porque, lamentablemente, no está implementado por completo, diría que en la mayoría de los sistemas ciegos, por cierto, sabíamos que los planes de tratamiento de dosis habían pasado por las métricas para la complejidad del plan.', 'Lo que nos resulta más difícil es de hacer es fijarnos en la robustez del plan.', 'Entonces, la robustez del plan, es algo que realmente, creo que es muy... es un problema clínico de alguna manera porque la complejidad del plan son las métricas que hacen los físicos, y las mantenemos bajo control, ya sabe, profesor Franco.', 'Pero la cuestión es que la robustez del plan es algo que los médicos deben estar acostumbrados a fijarse en la distribución de la dosis.', 'Si está usando un digamos relleno de color, coloca 100, 106 y mira dónde está esta dosis.', 'Por ejemplo, para una próstata, mira si están muy cerca del recto, porque significa que probablemente la optimización de la dosis se ha empujado mucho para sacar la dosis del recto, pero usted tiene una distribución de la dosis que no es muy robusta respecto a la posición del recto.', 'Si hace un ligero movimiento de estos 105, 110 o 7 puede caer en el recto.', 'Lo mismo para la cabeza y el cuello.', 'Así, para la cabeza y el cuello es otro buen ejemplo.', 'De este modo, puede, por ejemplo, podemos empujar la isolínea de 40 Gy.', 'Isodosis, fuera de la médula espinal.', 'Y puedo hacer nuestro siguiente histograma de dosis-volumen, porque está casi ahí, pero no está tocando la médula espinal, pero está demasiado cerca.', 'Así que para tener esta idea de eso, tienes algunos puntos que realmente, realmente, o por ejemplo, tienes algunos máximos cerca de la médula espinal, ese pequeño movimiento significa que no puedes tener el 107 dentro de algo que tiene que ser visto, y solo puedes verlo mirando la distribución de la dosis.', 'Y todavía no tenemos las herramientas en los sistemas de planificación de primer nivel, pero nunca tendremos las herramientas si los profesionales no las piden.', 'Ese es mi mensaje.', 'Básicamente, si no vamos a los proveedores y les decimos: «Lo sé, este papel era la planificación.', 'Quiero también para, para fotones.', 'Quiero estar seguro de que mi plan es robusto ante los movimientos.', 'Quiero darle importancia a la planificación básica también porque esto...»', 'Tengo fe.', 'Yo diría que esto tendrá un gran impacto para los pacientes, porque cuanto más robusto sea un plan, más coherente será el tratamiento.', 'Y luego, cuando empezamos a analizar la toxicidad, dijo que hay varias estandarizaciones de volúmenes, mirando también la robustez del plan.', 'Estas dos cosas son muy importantes para ajustar, nuestros modelos predictivos y hacerlos significativos.', 'Sí, fiables.', 'Sí.', 'Esto es lo que es.', 'Cierto, cierto.', 'Y Nuria, ¿cree que?, ha hablado de la robustez', '¿Cree que los nuevos enfoques que se están utilizando ahora, como una reoptimización diaria que se puede hacer, por supuesto, con máquinas nuevas basadas en RM, o haz cónico basado en TAC, cambiaría el enfoque? Porque, al menos teóricamente, quiero decir, la variación entre fracciones se debería tener en cuenta, entonces, por supuesto, la variación intrafracciones podría seguir existiendo, aún necesita ser gestionada y mitigada, pero cree que cambiará, o...', 'Creo, creo, sí, que el problema aquí, estoy segura de que para el paciente, sería mejor.', 'El problema aquí es que todavía no hemos llegado a eso con respecto a cómo estimamos la dosis que el paciente recibe cuando hacemos adaptativos.', 'Básicamente, la acumulación de dosis en adaptativos con las formaciones.', 'Es un problema muy difícil y sin resolver.', 'Pueden imaginar, por ejemplo, un ejemplo muy claro es un tumor pulmonar, que está reduciendo su tamaño.', 'Entonces, lo pones arriba en ese punto, pero entonces, puedes tener esto, o, un tumor de cabeza y cuello, aún mejor.', 'Entonces, tienes un tumor de cabeza y cuello cerca de la piel y el tratamiento está funcionando y consigues una reducción de este tumor.', '¿Cómo acumularás la dosis ahí?', 'Porque el tumor no está ahí.', 'Así que cómo deformas estos tejidos para saber cuál es la dosis real que ha recibido.', 'Entonces, es algo básico porque la masa, las dosis es julios por kilogramo.', 'Y si la masa no está ahí, ¿cómo se resuelve este problema?', 'Hay cosas que se han debatido, pero estas acumulaciones de dosis, con el fin de hacer un, de decirle a los radiooncólogos que este paciente ha recibido esta dosis, o este es el histograma final de dosis-volumen no es tan fácil cuando estamos haciendo adaptativos, aunque estoy segura de que para el paciente es lo mejor.', 'Así que, como máximo, puedo decirles, bueno, estoy segura de que no ha pasado por esta dosis en el recto, pero el concepto que se tiene ahora con los histogramas de dosis-volumen, de distribuciones de dosis tiene que ser repensado.', 'Y todavía hay muchos debates en curso en la comunidad física, sobre cómo hacer estas acumulaciones de dosis.', 'Sí, más...', 'Exacto, significativo.', 'Entonces, podemos fijarnos en esto, puedo hacerlo, pero piénselo, si algo desaparece, ¿cómo, cómo rastreas esa dosis?', 'Sí.', 'Si un vóxel está ahí y ahora ya no está ahí, ¿entonces cómo podemos manejar esto?', 'Eso es cierto.', 'Nuria, podemos...', 'Creo que estamos a punto de cerrar porque estamos sobrepasando un poco el tiempo, pero tal vez solo la consideración final, si quiere, hemos hablado de la calidad del plan y la calidad del plan, creo que es solo una pequeña parte de la calidad, en radioterapia.', 'Y es decir, ya sabe, yo sé que usted, por supuesto, es una experta también en la evaluación de la calidad, hablando en general de radioterapia, quiere hacer una observación final acerca de cómo la calidad es importante, evaluar la calidad no solo de los planes, sino en el proceso general de radioterapia para, en general, poder brindar una buena atención al paciente en el tratamiento del cáncer.', 'Oh, seguro.', 'Es decir, básicamente lo que se ha demostrado, y somos conscientes de ensayos clínicos que lo han analizado.', 'Que la calidad en el proceso completo de radioterapia tiene un enorme impacto en los resultados de los pacientes.', 'Por lo tanto, todos los pasos pequeños deben estar bajo control de algún modo para poder lograr un buen resultado.', 'Y esto se puede lograr en todo el equipo, actuando juntos.', 'Así que, todas las especialidades, radiooncólogos, físicos médicos, técnicos de radioterapia.', 'Quiero decir, su gente son la administración para hacer un seguimiento de la coordinación de los pacientes.', 'Es decir, se puede tener un plan perfecto, pero tal vez el paciente no pueda empezar hasta pasados dos meses.', 'Entonces, ¿qué importa tener una calidad perfecta del plan si el paciente no puede empezar?', 'De modo que estas pequeñas cosas de mantener esto bajo control siguen siendo importantes.', 'Y una buena recomendación es nunca, tener miedo de pasar por auditorías clínicas por personas externas.', 'Es un ejercicio excelente, y es algo que llegará a Europa por la nueva BSS.', 'Entonces, cómo hacer auditorías clínicas.', 'Podemos usar esto como una oportunidad para mejorar todos los resultados de los pacientes, o podemos usarlo como hagamos algo que podamos firmar y estamos con, dentro de la ley.', 'Y me gustaría animar a los que nos escuchan que es una excelente oportunidad para presionar a los gobiernos, para presionar las estructuras de las sociedades para que trabajen en cómo estructurar, estas auditorías clínicas de una manera mínima y significativa para que podamos mejorar la calidad de todos los tratamientos para todos los pacientes.', 'Correcto.', 'Correcto.', 'Ese es un muy buen mensaje final.', 'Así que, gracias.', 'Muchas gracias, Nuria.', 'Así que, gracias de nuevo por la charla muy perspicaz e interesante y muy educativa y gracias a todos por unirse.', 'Gracias por invitarme.', 'Ha sido un placer.', 'Gracias a todos, que tengan una buena noche.', 'Adiós.']\n",

don't quite fit into anything that we see in our flowcharts or guidelines and you really just have to take the individual patient and their and their cancer into account\", \"ah for example i think one of the biggest areas for us are patients who have hormone receptor positive disease where we're really struggling with when to abandon endocrine therapy\", 'we now have a number of different options and patients who have upfront resistance to endocrine therapy can be a very difficult area for us to determine', 'of course financial toxicity is an issue for our patients worldwide', 'we have different issues in the united states than other countries of the world with various insurance and medicare', \"ah but for all people in the world the increasing cost of cancer care is a big ah topic

there was a small but statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and a big improvement in overall survival', 'this data which was presented last year from keynote three five five showed that the addition of pembrolizumab to a menu of chemotherapy agents in patients whose disease was pdl one positive using something called the combined positive score or cps improved overall survival', 'Previous data had shown a four point about a four point one month improvement in progression-free survival.', 'this almost seven month increase in overall survival was very encouraging', 'and you can see the curve separate over time but only thirty eight percent of patients benefit based on this combined positive score', 'so that remains a big issue for us', 'selecting the patients trying to decide which tumor source should we biopsy the metastatic tumor or should we use archival tumor tissue', 'ah in these studies a large number of patients had archival tumor that was used for determination of the combined positive score', 'now in this particular disease setting it may not matter as much because many of the patients were recurring within a year of their last treatment in the early stage setting', 'but it still ends up being an ongoing discussion point about which tumor we should use for testing', 'we prefer to use tumor from the metastatic setting if we can', 'but it if because of the need to get this as soon as you diagnose a patient we often will do the tumor testing on archival tissue while we get the biopsy to confirm metastatic disease', 'we also looked to see whether or not we could expand the number of patients who would benefit from immunotherapy', 'This data presented by Javier Cortez at San Antonio this year showed that indeed a CPS of 10 showed here.', 'this is the cutoff of the combined positive score of ten or more', \"here's ten or more twenty or more for both overall survival and progression-free survival was really the right cutoff\", 'and that establishes a cps of ten being the cutoff to determine benefit of adding pembrolizumab to this menu of chemotherapy', 'the chemotherapy choices included nab-paclitaxel paclitaxel or gemcitabine and carboplatin', \"some physicians might prefer using gemcarbo even in patients who haven't had a prior taxane because you don't have hair loss and you don't have the problem with neuropathy although you can have a problem over time with thrombocytopenia\", \"but indeed it turns out when you looked at additional subset analyses that patients who received taxanes

months from their last exposure to a taxane in the early stage setting', 'Immuno-mediated adverse events are very important to consider.', 'you can see that any grade immune-mediated adverse events were increased by twenty', 'and this is where you had at least ten patients in either treatment group', \"The most common toxicities that we've seen involve the thyroid and actually skin is quite common in the early stage setting as well as in metastatic disease.\", 'Pero cualquier órgano puede ser afectado.', 'because the immune system is more suppressed in the metastatic setting than in the

chemotherapy can turn that around', \"and what i'll do is start at a very low dose of taxane if i can\", \"this patient refused the taxane so i gave her capecitabine and i'm holding my breath to see if her counsel come up\", 'ah but i have given really low doses of taxane in the setting and had patients recover', 'but then what i do is i stop the chemo and i not in this one patient i mentioned', \"she's got endocrine resistant disease\", \"but in other patients if that's a patient who still has endocrine sensitivity i would start endocrine therapy after i get the counts to normalize and try and use it as a chemotherapy holiday\", 'Sí, creo que un colega mío, como paciente, también está respondiendo muy bien a la quimioterapia metronómica, lo que significa que se trata de la quimioterapia y porque no quería tener una dosis completa.', \"So I think it's a, uh, in general, it's a very difficult situation to manage.\", 'Se desarrollan muy rápidamente y progresan muy rápidamente.', 'Así que creo que todavía tenemos un par de minutos para las preguntas.', 'Y um, eh, solo para.', \"there's one in chat\", 'a new one came in chat olivia', 'ah one in okay', 'Elena y soy.', 'for her to positive metastatic breast cancer with brain metastasis what do you recommend in a second line if trastuzumab is not approved or available', \"so indeed in this situation so if you have all of the drugs available to you we would use tocatnib capecitabine and trazodone in the second line setting because of the overall survival benefits seen in patients with brain metastases that's so striking\", 'Creo que tdxt, si lo tuvieras, no sería una opción irrazonable, pero creo que la mayoría de nosotros estaríamos acostumbrados a catnib en ese entorno.', \"and you know if there's that one tiny brain method that's progressing it doesn't matter so much\", \"if there's a whole host of them and you need to give whole brain radiation or they have already gotten radiation with some minor progression to cat and her two climb regimen would be are considered\", \"now let's say you don't have either of these really expensive new drugs and tecartinib is quite expensive um even though it's a pill and really hard for our patients who don't have full coverage\", 'Y si fideicomisarios, mi droga aún no está aprobada.', 'Tdm one actually has shown a benefit in brain metastases.', 'so you definitely see shrinkage', \"if it's a patient who has progressive brain mets in line two you could consider noratinib and capecitabine where there was data from the nalla trial showing some shrinkage\", 'i showed it in one of my summaries and as well as in the combination data where they saw longer disease control in patients with treated and controlled brain mets', 'um so that would be one option', \"but again i think that um even capecitabine with trazozumab is not an unreasonable option if a patient has already received tdm one and you don't have any of the other agents available\", \"Lepatanib also showed brain benefit in brain mets, but it's the weakest of our of our um uh oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors that block HER2 and EGFR.\", \"so i would use noradrenaline before lopatinib if i couldn't just dose reduce use the sort of dose escalation schedule and use the lowest dose possible to avoid a lot of diarrhea\", 'Y solo para añadir más sobre esto.', 'do you think that at least in her to positive disease given the benefit of these drugs would you change the recommendation not to screen for brain mets', 'or do you think we should revise our recommendation at least in her to positive disease', 'yeah you know i just brought this up we have some cases to present at a local conference and i the fellow who prepared them i said you know you really should ask this question because i think that people are are changing', \"although our guidelines still do not recommend doing screening brain imaging and the advanced breast cancer consensus group didn't recommend it there were a lot of people who voted for it\", 'so it was in no means a universal agreement', 'and i think that because we now have treatment and you know sometimes you see really bad disease where people have a lot of symptoms and you have to radiate a much bigger area', 'i think we are sort of shifting towards screening brain mris periodically', \"the question is we have no idea how frequently to do it and what to do and so we're a little bit still lost in that area\", 'i i do however think having seen some really significant cognitive dysfunction in patients over time then radiation necrosis which is a huge huge deal a huge area to manage', \"you know if we were just doing a talk on brain nets we'd talk about radiation necrosis too because that's a big area that keeps you awake at night\", 'but in those patients you know if we just radiated smaller areas maybe we would have less toxicity', \"so that's the i think the areas that we still need to answer but maybe we should be screening in some patients\", \"so i think there are no additional questions maybe just a comment because you just touched but baby i think it's important on parp inhibitors in in brca-mutated patients\", 'so maybe just some summary on the management of these women according to their sub-type because i think this is important as well', \"yeah i think that it is really important and i think that we it probably doesn't keep me awake as much at night because it's a small percentage of our population\", \"ah so i didn't include it there\", \"and of course there's limitate limits to what you can talk about\", \"but um if you know it's so important for patients to have germline brca testing\", \"and if you're going to do if a patient comes to you and they haven't had germline brackett testing you can do next next generation sequencing which you were going to do anyway for the cancer and you will get the mutation\", 'and then you can go back and do germline testing', 'so swab of the mucosa or if finances are still an ongoing issue you can treat them as brca positive because we have data suggesting that even for somatic mutations we see responses with parp inhibitors', 'and then i think another area that comes up is what about a patient has pal b two mutation', 'we see this in triple-negative disease as well as hormone receptor positive disease', 'and in that group of patients how would we you know decide about parp inhibitors', 'And we have seen that limited data, but really encouraging that these cancers also respond to PERP inhibition.', 'so i think that what i believe is that if you could give it we try and give it', \"you can get compassionate use from the companies that make parp inhibitors if there's no approval within your country for the drug largely not always but sometimes like if a patient has a pal b two mutation or a somatic mutation\", 'and then the other question is when should you give the parp inhibitor with the other treatment', \"and i think that for cdk four six inhibitors we believe that you should give them first before the parp inhibitor because we've seen these survival benefits\", 'so well tolerated in most patients', 'and then the parp inhibitor would be second line', \"in triple negative disease though we just don't have great options for patients who are pdl one negative which is the majority of our patients\", 'so if a patient could get a parp inhibitor first line i would choose that because i think that you know it just depends on how much disease they have and whether they have visceral crisis', \"but i also although again it's completely off label i would use a parp inhibitor as maintenance in patients after they got a response to chemotherapy if you have to start with chemo\", 'because i think the earlier you give the parp inhibitor the longer the patient will stay on and potentially those patients may have a benefit in survival in an unplanned subset analysis from the olympia trial', 'so i think here the the the scenario will become more and more complex because we will have adjuvant parp inhibitors is like the cdk four and six', 'so i think it will become more and more complicated and we are going to test more and more', 'Así que esta población de pacientes realmente aumenta con el tiempo.', 'Así que creo que tenemos que estar listos.', 'Yo soy.', 'we just have a patient who was on a trial and got a cdk four six inhibitor in the early stage setting', 'Y ella tiene palmo, así que se podría haber dado una CDK para seis en.', \"she didn't relapse on it\", 'it was after stopping', \"ah but she has a brca two mutation and it's just she had bone only and bone and pleura\", \"so i started her actually on olaparib and she's still on it now\", \"ah she's been on now for about seven months\", \"so it's actually a great option to consider\", 'Tienes que individualizar.', 'And also, you know, we tend to give, uh, carboplatin more and more in triple negative patients.', 'And if they are BRAKA positive, we do not have data on PARP inhibitors after platinum compounds.', 'So I think this is, you know, there are lots of things which are overlapping and we cannot have answers for that and we

            "['Thank you very much.', \"It's a pleasure to talk to you today.\", \"And hopefully, we'll have some interesting questions that come up as well.\", \"Let me just, I'm gonna share my slides and put them on.\", 'Okay, great.', 'So, our topic today is \" Things about advanced breast cancer that keep us awake at night.\"', \"And indeed, there are many different topics that we could discuss here because I was thinking about it as I was finishing up my slides and thinking that there are so many things that can keep us awake taking care of our patients, but we're gonna focus on just a few of them.\", 'And also, we can talk about any others that come up.', 'Okay, my disclosures here.', 'Okay, so, what are we gonna talk about?', 'About advanced breast cancer.', 'So, treating metastatic triple-negative breast cancer is certainly one.', \"We'll talk about immunotherapy, toxicity.\", 'Why do so few benefit from this treatment and whether or not we could extend immunotherapy to the most common subset of metastatic breast cancer, hormone receptor-positive disease.', 'Antibody drug conjugates are a very exciting new way to deliver chemotherapy that seems to be more effective with reduced toxicity.', \"An exciting press release today, I'll share with you.\", 'Brain metastases continue to be a big topic for us in terms of challenges and management.', 'And then, sequencing therapy.', \"I'll show you some examples of sequencing, but it continues to be a challenge.\", 'And as new agents are being studied, we always have to figure out how to fit in those agents, how best to treat our patients.', 'And even if you have a nice flow chart about how to treat a patient, we have to individualise the therapy for the patient.', \"So, there may be situations that don't quite fit into anything that we see in our flow charts or guidelines and you really just have to take the individual patient and their cancer into account.\", \"For example, I think one of the biggest areas for us are patients who have hormone receptor-positive disease where we're really struggling with when to abandon endocrine therapy.\", 'We now have a number of different options and patients who have upfront resistance to endocrine therapy can be a very difficult area for us to determine.', 'Of course, financial toxicity is an issue for our patients worldwide.', 'We have different issues in the United States than other countries of the world with various insurance and Medicare.', \"But for all people in the world, the increase in cost of cancer care is a big topic including just even how to manage your life when you're needing to come in for appointments without even considering the cost of drugs and your own share of cost.\", \"Other topics for discussion that we don't have time for.\", 'I mentioned the rapidly progressive hormone receptor-positive disease.', 'When can we stop antibodies in patients with HER2-positive disease who seemed to be without disease or NED for a long time?', 'Is 5 years enough?', 'Should we continue for 10 years?', 'This is a huge problem in countries where the drugs are only approved during the combination with chemotherapy.', 'And also, an issue for all of us because we want to have this tiny group of patients be our patients who are cured of disease.', 'And then the question about when we can actually... will it work as well to restart therapy if the cancer grows again, is a big question.', 'The same is true for immunotherapy.', 'The duration of treatment.', 'And then, management of refractory ascites is a big issue for our patients.', 'Lobular cancer tends to be an area where we really have trouble managing the cancer and lobular cancer over the spectrum of disease is an increasing issue that thankfully has achieved some recognition.', 'And then, patients who have chest-wall disease that can be incredibly difficult to manage.', \"Again, I chose not to discuss those because we don't have specific data with which to support decision-making.\", 'Hopefully, we will in the future.', \"So, let's start out and talk about immunotherapy.\", 'We saw in the last year remarkable data with immunotherapy in both early and late-stage hormone receptor-negative, HER2- negative, so-called triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Now, we had seen before data with atezolizumab, there was a small but statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and a big improvement in overall survival.', 'These data, which was presented last year from KEYNOTE-355 showed that the addition of pembrolizumab to a menu of chemotherapy agents in patients whose disease was PD-L1 positive using something called the combined positive score or CPS improved overall survival.', 'Previous data had shown about a 4.1 -month improvement in progression-free survival.', 'This almost 7-month increase in overall survival was very encouraging.', 'And you can see the curve separate over time, but only 38% of patients benefit based on this combined positive score.', 'So, that remains a big issue for us.', 'Selecting the patients, trying to decide which tumour source, should we biopsy the metastatic tumour or should we use archival tumour tissue?', 'In these studies, a large number of patients had archival tumour that was used for the determination of the combined positive score.', 'Now, in this particular disease setting, it may not matter as much because many of the patients were recurring within a year of their last treatment in the early-stage setting.', 'But it still ends up being an ongoing discussion point about which tumour we should use for testing.', 'We prefer to use tumour from the metastatic setting if we can.', \"But because of the need to get this as soon as you diagnose a patient, we often we'll do the tumour testing on archival tissue while we get the biopsy to confirm metastatic disease.\", 'We also look to see whether or not we could expand the number of patients who would benefit from immunotherapy.', 'These data presented by Javier Cortes at San Antonio this year showed that, indeed, a CPS of 10, showed here.', 'This is the cut-off of the combined positive score of 10 or more.', \"Here's 10 or more, 20 or more for both overall survival and progression-free survival was really the right cut-off.\", 'And that establishes a CPS of 10 being the cut-off to determine benefit of adding pembrolizumab to this menu of chemotherapy.', 'The chemotherapy choices included nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel or gemcitabine and carboplatin.', \"Some physicians might prefer using GemCarbo even in patients who haven't had a prior taxane because you don't have hair loss and you don't have the problem with neuropathy, although you can have a problem over time with thrombocytopenia.\", \"But indeed, it turns out when you look at additional subset analyses, the patients who receive taxanes may have done better than patients receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin, although, the trial wasn't powered to look at subsets.\", 'So, in general, we choose a taxane-partner if a patient is more 6 months from their last exposure to a taxane in the early-stage setting.', 'Immune- mediated adverse events are very important to consider.', 'You can see that any grade, immune-mediated adverse events were increased by 20%.', 'And this is where you had at least 10 patients in either treatment group.', \"The most common toxicities that we've seen involve the thyroid and actually, skin is quite common in the early-stage setting as well as in metastatic disease.\", 'But any organ can be affected.', 'Because the immune system is more suppressed in the metastatic setting than in the early-stage setting, my clinical experience is we tend to see less of the organ toxicities.', 'We see pneumonitis as you can see in colitis but hepatitis, less common.', 'We see a little bit less adrenal insufficiency.', 'Patients are receiving steroids so that we might not see it as well.', \"Also, the median survival for these patients, and It'll just go back to this slide.\", 'You can see that the median survival is still 23 months.', \"So, these patients aren't living a very long time still.\", \"So, it's still a big issue for us.\", 'But what I found is that you really need to be able to identify these immune toxicities early.', 'So, if a patient shows up with any kind of a funny symptom related to their treatment or unrelated, you have to think at immune toxicity.', \"We've seen even eosinophilic esophagitis as a toxicity and these toxicities can occur three months or more after the last dose of checkpoint inhibitor.\", 'So, I had one of the very first patients I treated with a checkpoint inhibitor got one dose on a clinical trial had progressive disease.', 'And three months later presented with life-threatening diarrhoea from colitis.', 'That was, of course, before we understood that we could identify it early.', 'So, definitely you want to be thinking immune toxicity with almost any side effect.', 'Now, I mentioned that Impassion-130 showed a benefit of atezolizumab added to nab-paclitaxel.', 'So, they used one chemotherapy partner.', 'And the difference here, you can see in medium progression-free survival was seen only in the patients who had PD-L1 immune cell positive disease.', 'They used an antibody SP142 and not a combined positive score.', 'The antibody with a combined positive score is 22C3.', \"I'll show you a little bit about that in just a moment.\", 'They did show an improvement in overall survival, initially, about 6.3 months.', 'But with longer term follow-up, the difference is very similar to that seen with pembrolizumab, as I just showed you with a 7-month improvement in overall survival.', \"As you can see, patients who didn't have a prior taxane seem to have a better hazard ratio for overall survival.\", 'Probably, just due to the development of resistance over time.', 'But it is remarkable to see this.', 'These are called landmark analyses where it goes from 22 to 36% at 3 years when you understand the median survival is still only about 2 years.', 'So, there is a subset of patients who really benefit tremendously from immunotherapy but in Impassion-130, only 40%, almost identical to KEYNOTE-355.', 'So, what happened with Impassion-130 is actually, I think, a really important lesson to all of us about statistical design.', \"It's not clear to me exactly even though I was on the steering committee why they had a hierarchical pre-specified statistical analysis plan.\", 'So, what they said was that you had to have a benefit in the intent-to-treat population for PFS and OS in order to look at the benefit in the subset of patients with PD-L1 positive disease.', 'So, they saw a benefit in PFS and intent-to-treat so, then they could go on to show that the benefit was only in the PD-L1 positive patients.', 'But for OS, as you might expect, there was no difference in patients in the intent-to-treat population because only 40% were PD-L1 positive.', 'So, this was a...', 'You can see the benefit, looks clinically very important, but it was not allowed by the statistical design to look at the overall survival in PD-L1 positive patients, so because of the intent-to-treat analysis.', 'So, they needed a confirmatory trial to have full approval.', \"And then next trial they did, Impassion-131, didn't show a benefit adding atezolizumab for very unclear reasons, since we saw these data very encouraging with pembrolizumab and encouraging data in the early-stage setting.\", 'So, that led to actually withdrawal of the US-accelerated approval of atezolizumab in the metastatic setting.', 'There is one ongoing study still looking at atezolizumab in the metastatic setting in a phase III trial and approval was not withdrawn in other countries because this was not a requirement.', 'It was from the USFDA but it, certainly, I think, has resulted in less use of atezolizumab in this setting.', 'I show you these data here from the different trial, is the Impassion-131, the negative trial.', 'This trial, as you can see, included almost the same number of patients.', 'And PD-L1 was positive in 45%.', 'Paclitaxel was the partner instead of nab-paclitaxel but we used steroids in the KEYNOTE-355 trial because of the nature of the chemotherapy.', 'There was a little less of the untreated patients de novo, but similar to KEYNOTE-355, prior taxanes, again, a little bit more and less in KEYNOTE-355.', \"It is possible that these differences, which we can't really understand, may have made the difference in not showing any benefit in PFS.\", 'Here, you can see the PFS was identical but there was no survival benefit either.', \"And the overall survival in the patient population who received paclitaxel alone was 28 months, longer than anything we've ever seen.\", 'So, it brings up the question about whether or not this patient population really was biologically different and whether or not we should be doing intrinsic subtyping to better understand chemotherapy benefit in these patients.', 'So, I just want to stop here and remind everybody that you can ask questions, comments anytime.', 'So, anything that pops up, just put something into the Q& A box.', 'Send your questions and comments.', \"We really want to hear from you and hear what you're thinking.\", \"And it doesn't have to be a question.\", 'It can be a comment.', 'So, I look forward to hearing from you.', \"Put them in as we're talking.\", 'So, what are the questions for metastatic use of checkpoint inhibitors?', 'Well, why is PD-L1 only important for metastatic disease?', 'We believe that this is due to immune suppression from burden of disease.', \"It's fascinating that we've shown that the benefit of checkpoint inhibitors is relatively greater in higher stage and node-positive disease in the early-stage setting where neoadjuvant pembrolizumab is now approved in the United States based on the results from KEYNOTE-522.\", 'So, we know that disease burden is associated with a lower chance of pathologic complete response and even in patients of a PCR, relatively slightly worse outcome.', \"So, could it be that it's the disease burden?\", \"And I suspect that what we're seeing here and there have been some very nice studies showing this with matched-samples is a reduction in expression of PD-L1 and more importantly, a reduction in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and increase in mutational complexity that increases chemotherapy resistance and a reduction in the host, the ability of the host to respond to the tumour immunologically.\", 'So, the tumour, actually, the more disease burden you have, the better able the tumour is to suppress the host immune response.', 'The best chemotherapy partner, we still...', \"I mentioned this already, we'd still choose nab-paclitaxel if we can as a chemotherapy partner and in patients who've had a taxane and have resistant disease, gemcitabine and carboplatin.\", \"We don't really know how long to continue the checkpoint inhibitor, so, we have patients who've had excellent response.\", 'And then, we stop the chemotherapy and we continue the checkpoint inhibitor.', 'KEYNOTE-355 stopped the pembrolizumab at 2 years, atezolizumab continued the checkpoint inhibitor.', \"So, we don't really know and we do know that you can have more immune toxicity the longer your exposure.\", 'And then, of course, so a few patients benefit relatively in a real-world population.', 'It might be only 30% or so.', 'We need to look at novel combinations and try and improve the effectiveness of checkpoint inhibitors.', \"And also, we're extending checkpoint inhibitors to other disease subsets like hormone receptor-positive disease.\", 'And the big question is which subsets should we include and how we should identify them?', \"I'm not sure that the randomised phase III trials are identifying the right population.\", \"So, we'll see.\", 'And then, there are many trials and the neoadjuvant, post-neoadjuvant and metastatic setting looking at checkpoint inhibitors in HER2-positive disease.', 'On the right, I show you that the tests that you do to determine PD-L1 positivity is really important, and that was an ongoing question as well.', 'Here, you can see that in the Impassion-130 trial, we were able to show that there was some overlap in positivity with SP142 and the CPS.', 'But I think on the other hand, there were a lot of patients who had disease only positive by SP142 or 22C3 using the CPS of 10 cut-off.', 'So, very interesting.', 'And I have now seen some patients who initially had an SP142 that was 0 and have a CPS of 50.', \"So, this is really a real issue, and I'm sure that we'll see the reverse as well.\", \"We just aren't doing SP142 now in the United States.\", 'There are many different studies that are looking at how to amplify the immune response.', \"I've just showed you a few here.\", 'Induction therapy to try and enhance the host immune response with the little chemo or radiation therapy.', \"There's an ongoing phase II trial looking at doxorubicin induction based on the higher response shown here with a tiny dose of doxorubicin induction and then nivolumab as a single agent.\", \"We're using induction in a BCRF, Breast Cancer Research Foundation-funded trial with a variety of different agents, a MEK inhibitor, the ADC sacituzumab govitecan and liposomal doxorubicin.\", 'We know it enhances the immune response in the neoadjuvant setting.', 'And then we combine it with the checkpoint inhibitor avelumab after a 2-week induction.', 'And Sara Tolaney and Ana Garrido-Castro are looking at sacituzumab either alone or in combination with pembrolizumab in the first-line setting in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer as well as hormone receptor-positive disease.', 'It was interesting data at San Antonio looking at patients receiving immunotherapy combinations who have a high tumour mutational burden or hypermutated HER2-negative metastatic disease.', 'But most of these patients interestingly have lobular cancer.', 'So, again, really important to think about that.', 'There are studies going on looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors that may enhance the immune response and radiation therapy that I think will be very important for us in the future.', \"Here's an example of the pre-data.\", 'So, the supporting data about looking at a checkpoint inhibitor in hormone receptor-positive disease.', 'These were patients who had PD-L1 positive heavily pre-treated hormone receptor-positive disease where we gave pembrolizumab monotherapy to.', 'The overall response was 12%.', 'It was a small number of patients, only 25, but the responses were very durable in those that responded.', 'And you can see that here in this bar plot and then in the spaghetti plot here where you can see the patients who did have a response.', 'It really was quite durable.', \"So, I think it's really interesting.\", 'We combine the checkpoint inhibitors now with chemotherapy because we know that chemotherapy enhances the immune response.', 'So, this is the ongoing KEYNOTE-B49 trial, which I am the US PI for, and Peter Schmid is the European PI.', 'Patients can receive again a menu of chemotherapy including paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, liposomal doxorubicin or capecitabine along with pembrolizumab.', 'And then, to be eligible, the patients have to have PD-L1 positive disease.', \"So, hopefully this will get around the fact that they're not dividing the patient group up by biologic criteria such as patients who have more luminal B disease, more endocrine-resistant disease.\", 'And the CPS is one for the cut-offs.', 'So, we will need to look at a CPS of 10 or greater in the final analysis shown here.', \"So, this trial, of course, is accruing, although slowly, because the number of patients who are CPS-positive who have hormone receptor-positive disease are small and we haven't quite figured out exactly how to identify them.\", 'So, hopefully, this will improve over time.', 'Antibody drug conjugates are a really exciting new area.', 'The antibody drug conjugate sacituzumab govitecan is a Trop- 2 antibody with the active metabolite of irinotecan attached and with a high drug antibody ratio.', \"So, the toxin is SN-38, which is great because you're delivering the toxin directly to the cancer cell with an antibody drug conjugate.\", \"You also get something called a bystander effect which is really very cool, meaning that even tumours that don't express the target of your antibody may be killed.\", \"Some ADCs are better at bystander effect than others and we don't understand that well.\", \"We also don't understand the toxicity of ADCs.\", \"We can't really measure the toxin in the blood, but we still see toxin-related toxicities with all the newer generation ADCs much more than trastuzumab emtansine.\", 'For sacituzumab, we see more neutropenia.', 'About 50% of patients needed growth factors but almost no patients discontinued due to adverse events.', 'So, you can actually control pretty much all of the toxicity well and diarrhoea, you can manage pretty well.', '10% grade 3 but with anti-diarrheal agents and dose reduction, this is easy to control.', 'The first analysis of the ASCENT trial shown here showed an improvement in progression-free and overall survival that was statistically significant in heavily pre-treated patients with triple-negative disease.', 'So, very exciting data and this established sacituzumab as a new treatment option in the second or greater line for triple-negative breast cancer.', 'But, of course, patients still die of their cancer and as you can see here, the overall survival median was 12.1 months in these patients who the median number of prior lines of therapy was three to four.', 'So, what else can we do?', \"Well, we have other ADCs that we're evaluating and then, we can move these drugs, of course, into the early-stage setting.\", \"Datopotamab deruxtecan is a Trop-2 ADC that I'll show you in just a second.\", \"And then, ladiratuzumab vedotin is against LIV1A, that's the antibody, but the toxin results in some neuropathy.\", \"So, it's still being evaluated with different schedules.\", 'Trastuzumab deruxtecan, of course, is being evaluated in HER2-low disease.', \"Again, I'll comment on that in just a moment.\", \"And then there's a HER3 ADC that has breakthrough status from the USFDA for eGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer.\", \"There are a number of phase III trials we'll talk about just a second.\", 'And then, new directions in combination with immunotherapy that, I think, are very exciting as well.', 'This trial with datopotamab deruxtecan is now open and enrolling TROPION-Breast01 in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and that trial in triple-negative disease will open later this year.', 'We only have data, interestingly, with Dato-Dxd in triple-negative disease but we expect to see hormone receptor-positive disease at ASCO.', \"These data was updated at San Antonio in 2021 and showed very nice response rates in this small number of patients and the patients who hadn't received a prior topoisomerase I inhibitor-based ADC, the response rate was over 50%.\", 'But again, this is just 27 patients.', 'And you can see that the responses were remarkably durable for this antibody drug conjugate.', 'Fascinating thing about this ADC is that the drug to antibody ratio for trastuzumab deruxtecan and sacituzumab is 7 1/ 2 to 8.', \"For this one, it's about 4.\", 'But the toxicity is completely different.', 'It seems very effective but there was a lot of nausea, which we see with trastuzumab deruxtecan.', 'So, I think this is the toxin.', 'But they saw a lot of stomatitis and 10% of it was grade 3.', \"So, we have no idea why that is since we don't see that with any other ADCs that use deruxtecan as the toxin.\", \"HER2-low is a very area and today, it's become even more exciting.\", 'This is a funny definition, not clearly a biologically relevant, but it was still defined based on a early phase I study with trastuzumab deruxtecan.', 'So, HER2-low has a higher prevalence in hormone receptor-positive disease than triple-negative disease, 65 versus 37%.', \"And it's defined as being 1+ or 2+ by immunohistochemistry for HER2-and not-amplified by in-situ hybridization.\", 'So, you can see that this is also divided by luminal a, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like.', \"And what you can see is that once you have IHC 1 and 2+ not-amplified, you're seeing relatively less basal-like compared to the IHC 0, and you're seeing an expansion of luminal B. I mean this is really where all of this group is.\", 'So, the majority of these patients have luminal A and B disease, which is interesting because that, of course, is a hormone receptor- positive cohort.', 'There are a number of ongoing trials.', 'DESTINY-Breast06, there are trials that are looking at compared to chemotherapy of physician choice.', \"There is a disitamab vedotin that's also looking in HER2-low disease that's targeted to HER2.\", 'But a DESTINY-Breast04, which is a phase III trial that randomised patients who had centrally defined HER2-low, a metastatic breast cancer that capped the number of patients with triple-negative disease.', 'Patients were randomised 2 to 1 to receive trastuzumab deruxtecan or chemotherapy of physician choice, and the numbers are listed here.', 'You can see the numbers of total patients in the trial, 360 versus 180.', 'The primary endpoint was PFS, secondary endpoint, overall survival, and, of course, response and duration of response.', 'We participated in this trial which allowed patients who had received up to two prior lines of chemotherapy and had exhausted their endocrine therapy options.', 'Today, there was a press release from AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo, who collaborated together on this drug, which has the brand name of Enhertu and I just copied and pasted the press release, so, we have a brand name on here.', 'But this showed that there was an improvement in not just progression-free, but also overall survival.', 'And this shows you a statistically significant, and, of course, they say clinically meaningful, improvement in PFS and OS in HER2-low disease, metastatic disease in the first or second-line, I guess, second or third-line setting.', 'So, they say regardless of hormone receptor status.', 'So, they have must have seen this in both the triple-negative and the hormone receptor-positive groups.', \"So, very, very exciting data that we'll see at ASCO this year but will change the way we treat patients with metastatic disease, I think, in a not-too- distant future, depending on drug availability.\", 'I also highlight the fact that sacituzumab govitecan was tested in hormone receptor-positive metastatic disease with up to more lines of therapy.', 'So, you had to receive at least two lines of chemotherapy and up to five.', \"So, more heavily pre-treated compared to chemotherapy of physician's choice.\", 'These data will be presented at ASCO but is not yet available to us but should be in the near future.', 'So, again, questions, anytime, you have comments.', \"I don't see anything in the comment box yet but please feel free to put comments into the Q& A box and questions at any time.\", 'So, brain metastases are clearly an unmet clinical need.', \"It's a frequent site of metastatic disease, up to 50% of patients with metastatic HER2-positive disease, up to 50% with metastatic triple-negative disease and often leads to rapid death in triple-negative breast cancer.\", \"And then, in hormone receptor-positive disease, we're seeing more brain metastases because our patients are living longer and we have better options for treatment.\", 'It appears to be increased in patients who have PIK3CA mutations and in about a half patients who have germline BRCA mutations.', 'It can be seen in patients, sort of really painfully, who have very well-controlled systemic disease.', 'We can see continued inexorable progression in the brain and then, development of leptomeningeal disease over time.', 'And here you can see this enhancement of the leptomeninges as well in this patient.', 'Recurrence after radiation is common and radiation toxicity is limiting for patients.', \"And, of course, because of the blood- brain barrier that we don't understand well, there's limited exposure to cyto-toxics.\", 'And most trials, up until very recently, excluded patients with brain metastases.', 'We saw, even though we markedly improved outcome for HER2-positive disease that even when we gave patients with residual disease T-DM1 or the antibody drug conjugate versus trastuzumab and showed a big improvement in patients who are at risk of distant recurrence that there was still a continued risk of CNS disease that was unchanged.', 'So, this shows you distant recurrence very much improved from the KATHERINE trial with T-DM1 but no difference in the development of CNS metastases.', 'So, that brought up a lot of interest in trying to understand how we could improve outcome.', 'There are a number of different chemotherapy combinations that have shown limited efficacy in patients with refractory brain metastases.', 'But these are generally very short-lived with the exception of some small studies, bevacizumab, cisplatin, etoposide in 35 patients, for example.', \"Where we've seen more improvement is in HER2-targeted therapies, not with these groups but we did see some responses.\", 'We even see it with trastuzumab emtansine or T-DM1 where there was a response rate in 10 patients of 30%.', 'Again, tiny numbers but still encouraging.', \"So, let's talk about some of the data that we have.\", 'So, we looked at abemaciclib as a collaboration in patients who had brain metastases with Lilly and Sara Tolaney published these data in 2020 showing really limited responses in patients with brain metastasis.', 'We do see these longer survivals in patients who have hormone receptor-positive disease.', \"Here's the hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative cohort, response rate of 5.2%, just 3 patients out of 58 but the intracranial clinical benefit rate was 24%.\", \"So, although, they didn't meet their primary endpoint in the patients with hormone receptor-positive disease who have brain metastases, we often do choose abemaciclib as the CDK4/ 6 inhibitor partner to endocrine therapy.\", 'They did see a lot of a abemaciclib in the CSF, a fascinating evaluation, where they looked at a abemaciclib analytes.', 'Not so much response in HER2-positive disease and leptomeningeal disease.', 'Again, they did see a response but it was very short-lived in these patients, and there were only 10 patients enrolled.', 'Neratinib, capecitabine has been studied in patients who had HER2-positive disease.', 'And these data were published in the JCO by Rachel Freedman.', 'And you can see that there was actually a pretty good CNS response rate, 49%.', \"And if you looked at the... that's by looking at the volumetric response.\", 'If you looked at the sum of the longest diameters, it was 24%.', \"So, it's still pretty good compared to what we saw before.\", 'Nine responses, and they tended to be more durable as long as patients were staying on therapy.', \"Unfortunately, this combination causes a lot of diarrhoea but it's still a treatment option although not without regulatory approval.\", 'And then we saw these data, which does have regulatory approval adding tucatinib to trastuzumab and capecitabine in patients who have progressed on all available therapies.', 'Trastuzumab, pertuzumab and trastuzumab emtansine.', 'They saw an improvement in progression-free survival in the 291 patients with brain metastases.', \"And this trial actually allowed patients to go on, who had active brain mets, that patients didn't need immediate treatment for.\", 'So, it was quite encouraging.', \"And here, you can see that it wasn't just progression-free survival but overall survival that was improved in patients with brain metastases.\", \"And I've given tucatinib to two patients now who've had progressive brain mets despite radiation and really who can't get more radiation.\", \"One of the patients didn't have a good response but I suspect now that this was a radiation necrosis that we didn't, wasn't read prop., we couldn't tell.\", \"But the other patient who has multiple cystic brain metastases and basically would've gone on hospice otherwise went on this triplet regimen from HER2CLIMB and now, still has continuing response to disease 8 months after starting this therapy.\", \"And it's really remarkable.\", 'Each sequential brain MRI shows response to therapy.', 'So, very exciting.', 'DESTINY-Breast03 also looked at patients who had brain metastases at baseline but they had to be controlled.', 'So, a little bit different.', 'These data were presented by Sara Hurvitz at San Antonio this year.', 'And here it shows you history of brain mets or brain mets at baseline with data in that group.', \"And it's interesting because this trial looked at trastuzumab deruxtecan versus T-DM1.\", 'So, T-DXd versus T-DM1, and you can see that there was a marked improvement in medium progression-free survival using T-DXd and the 12-month PFS rate with a hazard ratio 0.25 if you had brain met at baseline.', 'So, it does look like there may be effectiveness in that patient population.', \"It's being evaluated now.\", 'So, that is an ongoing evaluation.', 'Intracranial response rates are shown here in patients with brain mets.', 'So, they actually look to see if the brain mets have shrunk further.', \"Now, you can't take away the long-term effects of radiation but still, that dramatic improvement, almost a doubling, is pretty encouraging.\", 'This shows you the intracranial response, again, using RECIST 1.1.', 'And you can see how much better it is for T-DM1 versus T-DXd.', \"Actually, I wanted to bring up one thing that's important to think about in brain mets is that people don't think that RECIST is maybe the best way or the volumetric response.\", 'So, RANO response criteria is a way of looking at the volumetric response.', 'And it shows you how you use the target lesions with complete response, partial response and stable disease.', \"So, it's actually very helpful to look at this and it includes the volumetric response, which I think is really helpful.\", 'Published in 2015.', \"So, again, I see there's a couple of questions, which we'll answer in just a moment because we're just about done.\", \"I think there's a really important area I think there's a really important area preventing cognitive decline.\", 'with radiation over time, like over and over again, stereotactic radiation whole brain. stereotactic radiation the whole brain.', 'And they do get...', 'Some of these patients just have horrible cognitive dysfunction that contributes to their death.', 'Memantine in a randomised phase III trial showed a significantly longer time to cognitive decline.', 'If you took the memantine during the whole brain radiation and most people continue it and then, altered radiation technique is the most recent attempt to reduce the long-term effects is the most recent attempt to reduce the long-term effects And, you add it to whole-brain radiation therapy, so, you basically try and spare the hippocampus so you basically try and spare the hippocampus from radiation using intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'And actually, there was a significant reduction in risk of cognitive failure and less deterioration at four and six months in both executive function and then learning in memory So, that has now become a standard for whole-brain radiation therapy for whole brain radiation therapy at least at our institution.', 'And lastly, leptomeningeal disease is just a horrible area for progression in breast cancer.', \"So, this is older data, So this is older data, but I feel like we're seeing it much more frequently now.\", 'You see it more in lobular histology and 35% of patients with leptomeningeal disease have lobular histology as well as triple-negative disease.', \"And the life expectancy after diagnosis tends to be very short unless it's at the initial diagnosis So, diagnosis is generally by checking the CSF So diagnosis is generally by checking the CSF and we're looking at other ways to look at diagnosis of LMD in patients who have symptoms in those cells using cell-free DNA.\", 'Treatment has been intrathecal with methotrexate but there are new directions being evaluated, kind of disappointing results from intrathecal trastuzumab.', 'And radiation is used for bulky lesions up front.', 'There are a number of different studies that are being, treatments that are evaluated.', 'I thought some of the most interesting ones were using IV or intrathecal pembrolizumab or nivolumab, which is really interesting.', \"And there's actually a case report from one of our senior fellows looking at giving intrathecal checkpoint inhibitor melanoma and showing this dramatic shrinkage in disease in a patient who had LMD.\", \"There's a really interesting drug, paclitaxel conjugated to Angiopep-2 that targets a receptor called LRP1 on the blood-brain barrier that's upregulated in brain tumours.\", 'And this targeting facilitates receptor-mediated transcytosis across the blood- brain barrier.', 'They have some really interesting preliminary results and have had some issues with the company being bought by another company and developing drug.', \"But hopefully, we'll see this in a clinical trial soon.\", 'And then my colleagues as well as others are looking at cell-free DNA and the CSF to characterise the immune in environment and look at potential targets maybe for early detection as well.', 'So, sequencing therapy.', \"I'll just show you this as we finish here.\", \"In PD-L1 positive disease, we're using pembrolizumab, chemotherapy choice based on the time from last therapy, PARP inhibitors in patients who have a germline BRCA mutations and maybe in those who have acquired somatic mutations in BRCA.\", \"BRCA wild-type, we really don't have great options other than chemotherapy and the antibody drug conjugate sacituzumab.\", \"Maybe we'll also have trastuzumab deruxtecan in the near future.\", 'And then, for high tumour mutational burden and high MSI, you can use is pembrolizumab based on our US approval.', \"It depends on where it's approved.\", 'And atezolizumab is still approved in many places in the world.', 'For hormone receptor-positive disease, this is kind of a tiny slide, but from our ASCO guideline update, basically, the recommendation from all guidelines is that CDK4/ 6 inhibitors be used in the first-line setting, preferably in combination with an aromatase inhibitor unless a patient has already received an AI and developed metastatic disease, in which case, shown up here, you would go to fulvestrant.', 'But otherwise, I think right now, we want to save fulvestrant for the second-line setting in combination with alpelisib or everolimus depending on the PIK3CA mutation status.', 'And managing toxicity for those agents is another area that keeps us awake at night.', 'And then, of course, you can use tamoxifen.', \"We don't know what CDK after CDK4/ 6 inhibitors do, and there's a lot of interest in that area as well, how to use endocrine therapy in the third-line setting.\", \"There's a whole bunch of work going on with oral selective oestrogen receptor downregulators and new endocrine therapies like androgen receptor modulators that I think will give us a lot more options in the future that we can then use in patients who received a CDK4/ 6 inhibitor in the adjuvant setting where we now will have an additional question about how to treat those patients.\", \"I'll skip through this one and just go to the metastatic HER2- positive disease where we made a lot of progress as well with trastuzumab deruxtecan as well as the tucatinib HER2CLIMB regimen, which really have changed our sequencing of therapy.\", \"And now, we're gonna have to think about trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients to have HER2-low disease as well.\", 'Lastly, financial toxicity is really a huge issue for our patients and it can result in treatment non-adherence or refusal.', 'People lose their jobs.', \"Also, they die earlier if they don't get therapy.\", 'And this is a huge issue.', \"We have patients who won't come in for their treatment because they can't have childcare or they can't afford their drugs.\", \"And that's a such a big issue, and there's a lot of attention on this worldwide.\", \"We certainly haven't fixed it because finances are an issue for patients in all areas of life.\", \"And I think it's just... addressing financial hardship is really important as we start treating patients with breast cancer.\", 'So, I will end here with just listing the other topics for discussion and turn over the podium to Olivia and show you the advanced breast cancer Consensus guideline in the last in-person meeting.', 'We will have a mini-meeting in November of this year in Lisbon and encourage you all to listen in or attend if you can.', 'Thank you, Hope.', 'Very comprehensive.', 'And yes, really very interesting, and also, a question- generating.', 'We have two questions from Simona.', 'The first one is, in patients with leptomeningeal disease HR-positive, HER2-negative, would you recommend the CDK4 inhibitor or chemotherapy?', 'And if yes, do you have a preferred regimen?', 'So, I think a lot of it depends on how much leptomeningeal disease they have.', 'So, some patients have no symptoms and they have some leptomeningeal thickening on imaging.', \"In those patients, I tend to treat them as if they don't have LMD and I will use... usually those patients also have disease in their CNS proper.\", \"So, I treat with radiation therapy and then I would treat them as I would if they didn't have LMD.\", 'One of my patients actually lived almost five years initially presented bilateral lobular cancer, leptomeningeal disease as well as a few brain metastases.', \"And she was well without ever recurrence of leptomeningeal disease and that didn't really show up again until much later in her disease course.\", \"But for most patients, this isn't the case and they're symptomatic.\", 'And what I do is I initially treat with radiation and our radiation oncologists do that as well.', 'Unless you have disease that extends and you wanna get an MRI of the spine.', 'So, you look at the brain and then the spine.', \"If they have disease that's throughout the brain and the spine, you can't radiate everything.\", 'So, then I treat with intrathecal therapy with methotrexate.', 'And then, for systemic chemotherapy, we try and use the drugs that cross the blood-brain barrier.', 'So, capecitabine.', \"Etoposide isn't approved for breast cancer but one of my colleagues who's very interested in this has given a combination of cisplatin and etoposide with very nice results in a small number of patients.\", 'It really depends on how chemotherapy responsive the cancer cells are that have invaded the leptomeninges and what the systemic disease looks like and how symptomatic the patient is.', \"And how many lines they receive, if it's the first relapse or not.\", 'And always from Simona, you consider bone marrow invasion as visceral crisis and so, recommend chemotherapy or a CDK4/ 6 can be used in the setting in patients with luminal and metastatic breast cancer?', 'So, I think that...', \"It's an interesting question because most of our patients with bone metastases have bone marrow invasion.\", 'So, what I consider a visceral crisis is pancytopenia.', 'So, a patient comes in with platelets of 65.', 'That is visceral crisis and in fact, in most of those patients, if they really, I mean, one of my patients now who developed metastatic disease after multiple lines of endocrine therapy because she had local recurrences and progressed on fulvestrant and abemaciclib with pancytopenia.', \"And it's interesting, you can't really see the cancer all that well on imaging but her platelets dropped to 65,000 and she's got transfusion-dependent anaemia.\", 'And in that case, I really find that only chemotherapy can turn that around.', \"And what I'll do is start at a very low-dose of taxane if I can.\", \"This patient refused the taxane, so I gave her capecitabine and I'm holding my breath to see if her count-cells come up.\", 'But I have given really low doses of taxane in the setting and had patients recover.', 'But then, what I do is I stop the chemo and not in this one patient I mentioned.', \"She's got endocrine-resistant disease.\", \"But in other patients if that's a patient who still has endocrine sensitivity, I would start endocrine therapy after I get the counts to normalise and try and use it as a chemotherapy holiday.\", \"Yeah, I think a colleague of mine has a patient who is responding very well to metronomic chemotherapy, which means capecitabine and because she didn't want to have a full dose.\", \"So, I think it's, in general, is a very difficult situation to manage.\", 'They develop very quickly and they progress very quickly.', 'So, I think we have still a couple of minutes for questions.', 'And just for...', \"There's one in chat.\", 'A new one came in the chat, Olivia.', 'Ah, one in, okay.', 'Elena, yes, sorry.', 'For HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer with brain metastasis, what do you recommend in second-line if trastuzumab deruxtecan is not approved or available?', \"So, indeed, in this situation, so, if you have all of the drugs available to you, we would use tucatinib, capecitabine and trastuzumab in the second-line setting because of the overall survival benefits seen in patients with brain metastases that's so striking.\", 'I think that T-DXd if you had it would not be an unreasonable choice, but I think most of us would use tucatinib in that setting.', \"And if there's a one tiny brain met that's progressing, it doesn't matter so much.\", \"If there's a whole host of them and you need to give whole- brain radiation or they have already gotten radiation with some minor progression, tucatinib HER2CLIMB regimen would be, are considered.\", \"Now let's say you don't have either of these really expensive new drugs and tucatinib is quite expensive even though it's a pill, and really hard for our patients who don't have full coverage.\", \"And if trastuzumab deruxtecan isn't approved.\", 'T-DM1 actually has shown benefit in brain metastasis.', 'So, you definitely see shrinkage.', \"If it's a patient who has progressive brain mets in line-two, you could consider neratinib and capecitabine where there was data from the NALA Trial showing some shrinkage.\", 'I showed it IN one of my summaries and as well as in the combination data where they saw longer disease control in patients with treated and controlled brain mets.', 'So, that would be one option.', \"But again, I think that even capecitabine with trastuzumab is not an unreasonable option if a patient has already received T-DM1 and you don't have any of the other agents available.\", \"Lapatinib also showed benefit in brain mets but it's the weakest of our oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors that block HER2-and eGFR.\", \"So, I would use neratinib before lapatinib, if I couldn't, just dose reduce, use sort dose escalation schedule and use the lowest dose possible to avoid a lot of diarrhoea.\", 'And just to add on this.', 'Do you think that at least in HER2-positive disease, given the benefit of these drugs, would you change the recommendation not to screen for brain mets?', 'Or do you think we should revise our recommendation, at least in HER2-positive disease?', 'Yeah, you know I just brought this up where we have some cases to present at a local conference and the fellow who prepared them, I said, \" You know, you really should ask this question because I think that people are changing.\"', \"Although, our guidelines still do not recommend doing screening brain imaging and the advanced breast cancer Consensus group didn't recommend it, there were a lot of people who voted for it.\", 'So, it was in no-means a universal agreement.', 'And I think that because we now have treatment and that sometimes you see really bad disease where people have a lot of symptoms and you have to radiate a much bigger area.', 'I think we are sort of shifting towards screening brain MRIs periodically.', \"The question is we have no idea how frequently to do it and what to do and so we're a little bit still lost in that area.\", 'I do however think having seen some really significant cognitive dysfunction in patients over time then radiation necrosis, which is a huge, huge deal, a huge area to manage.', \"If we were just doing a talk on brain mets, we'd talk about radiation necrosis too because that's a big area that keeps you awake at night.\", 'But in those patients, if we just radiated smaller areas, maybe, we would have less toxicity.', \"So, that's the, I think, the areas that we still need to answer but maybe we should be screening in some patients.\", \"So, I think there are no additional questions, maybe, just a comment because you just touched maybe, I think it's important on PARP inhibitors in BRCA-mutated patients.\", 'So, maybe just some summary on the management of these women according to their subtype because I think this is important as well.', \"Yeah, I think that it is really important, and I think that we, it probably doesn't keep me awake as much at night because it's a small percentage of our population.\", \"So, I didn't include it there.\", \"And, of course, there's limits to what you can talk about.\", \"But if it's so important for patients to have had germline BRCA testing.\", \"And if you're gonna do it, if patient comes to you and they haven't had germline BRCA testing, you can do next generation sequencing, which you were gonna do anyway for the cancer and you will get the mutation.\", 'And then, you can go back and do germline testing.', 'So, swab of the mucosa or if finances are still an ongoing issue, you can treat them as BRCA positive because we have data suggesting that even for somatic mutations, we see responses with PARP inhibitors.', 'And then, I think another area that comes up is what about a patient has PALB2 mutation.', 'We see this in triple-negative disease as well as hormone receptor- positive disease.', 'And in that group of patients, how would we decide about PARP inhibitors.', 'And we have seen limited data but really encouraging that these cancers also to PARP inhibition.', 'S, I think that what I believe is that if you could give it, we try and give it.', \"You can get compassionate use from the companies that make PARP inhibitors if there's no approval within your country for the drug, largely, not always but sometimes, like if a patient has PALB2 mutation or a somatic mutation.\", 'And then, the other question is when should you give the PARP inhibitor with the other treatment?', \"And I think that for CDK4/ 6 inhibitors, we believe that you should give them first before the PARP inhibitor because we've seen these survival benefits.\", 'So, well-tolerated in most patients.', 'And then the PARP inhibitor would be second-line.', \"In triple-negative disease though, we just don't have great options for patients who are PD-L1 negative, which is the majority of our patients.\", 'So, if a patient could get a PARP inhibitor first-line, I would choose that because I think that it just depends on how much disease they have and whether they have visceral crisis.', \"But I also, although again it's completely off-label, I would use a PARP inhibitor as maintenance in patients after they got a response to chemotherapy if you have to start with chemo.\", 'Because I think the earlier you give the PARP inhibitor, the longer the patient will stay on and potentially those patients may have a benefit in survival in a unplanned subset analysis from the OlympiA trial.', \"So, I think here the scenario will become more and more complex because we will have adjuvant PARP inhibitors, it's like the CDK4/ 6.\", \"So, I think it'll become more and more complicated and we are going to test more and more.\", 'So, this population of patients will increase over time.', 'So, I think we need to be ready.', 'Also...', 'We just have a patient who was on a trial and got a CDK4/ 6 inhibitor in the early-stage setting.', 'And she got palbo so you could have given her just a different CDK4/ 6 inhibitor.', \"She didn't relapse on it.\", 'It was after stopping.', 'But she has a BRCA2 mutation and she had bone and pleura.', \"So, I started her actually on olaparib and she's still on it now.\", \"She's been on now for about seven months.\", \"So, it's actually a great option to consider.\", 'You just have to individualise.', 'And also, we tend to give carboplatin more and more in triple-negative patients.', \"And if they're are BRCA positive, we do not have data on PARP inhibitors after platinum compounds.\", 'So, I think there are lots of things which are overlapping and we cannot have answers for that and we will never have from clinical trials as well.', 'So, I think we are going out of our time.', 'I think it was really very useful.', 'So next time, you will be engaged again for this talk, Hope, so, because I think it was really very interesting and stimulating, and thank you very much.', 'Thank you very much, and thanks to all of you who are listening and for your great questions.', 'Thanks.', 'Take care.', 'Bye-bye.']\n",

'Ahora, en este contexto concreto de la enfermedad, puede no ser tan importante porque muchas de las pacientes recidivaban en el año siguiente a su último tratamiento en el estadio incipiente.', 'Pero aun así termina siendo un tema de debate vigente, qué tumor deberíamos usar para las pruebas.', 'Preferimos usar tumores de la enfermedad metastásica si podemos.', 'Pero dada la necesidad de obtenerlo en cuanto se diagnostica a una paciente, a menudo haremos la prueba del tumor en tejido de archivo mientras obtenemos la biopsia para confirmar la enfermedad metastásica.', 'También queremos ver si podríamos o no ampliar el número de pacientes que se beneficiarían de la inmunoterapia.', 'Estos datos presentados por Javier Cortés en San Antonio este año muestran que, efectivamente, aquí se muestra una CPS de 10.', 'Este es el punto de corte de la puntuación positiva combinada de 10 o más.', 'Aquí tenemos 10 o más, 20 o más para la supervivencia global y la supervivencia sin progresión fue realmente el punto de corte correcto.', 'Y se establece que una CPS de 10 es el punto de corte para determinar el beneficio de añadir pembrolizumab a este régimen de quimioterapia.', 'Las opciones de quimioterapia incluyeron nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel o gemcitabina y carboplatino.', 'Algunos médicos pueden preferir el uso de GemCarbo incluso en pacientes que no han recibido un taxano previamente porque no se observa pérdida de cabello y no hay problemas de neuropatía, aunque es posible que con el tiempo haya problemas de trombocitopenia.', 'Pero, de hecho, resulta que cuando miras otros análisis de subgrupos, las pacientes que reciben taxanos pueden haber tenido mejores resultados que las pacientes que reciben gemcitabina y carboplatino, aunque el ensayo no tenía la potencia suficiente para examinar subgrupos.', 'Por lo tanto, en general, elegimos como acompañante un taxano si han pasado más de 6 meses desde la última exposición de una paciente a un taxano en el estadio incipiente.', 'Es muy importante tener en cuenta los acontecimientos adversos inmunomediados.', 'Se puede ver que los acontecimientos adversos inmunomediados de cualquier grado aumentaron en un 20%.', 'Y aquí es donde había al menos 10 pacientes en cualquier grupo de tratamiento.', 'Las toxicidades más frecuentes que hemos visto afectan a la glándula tiroidea y, de hecho, la piel es bastante frecuente en el estadio incipiente, así como en la enfermedad metastásica.', 'Pero cualquier órgano puede verse afectado.', 'Dado que el sistema inmunitario está más inhibido en pacientes con metástasis que en casos incipientes, mi experiencia clínica es que tendemos a ver menos toxicidades orgánicas.', 'Vemos neumonitis como se puede ver en colitis pero hepatitis, menos frecuente.', 'Vemos algo menos insuficiencia suprarrenal.', 'Las pacientes están recibiendo corticoesteroides por lo que puede que tampoco podamos verlo.', 'Además, la mediana de supervivencia de estas pacientes, y voy a volver a esta diapositiva.', 'Pueden ver que la mediana de supervivencia sigue siendo de 23 meses.', 'Así que estas pacientes no viven durante mucho tiempo.', 'Por lo tanto, sigue siendo un gran problema para nosotros.', 'Pero lo que encontré es que realmente es necesario poder identificar estas toxicidades inmunitarias pronto.', 'Así que si una paciente aparece con algún tipo de síntoma extraño relacionado con su tratamiento o no relacionado, tienes que pensar en la toxicidad inmunitaria.', 'Hemos visto incluso esofagitis eosinofílica como una toxicidad y estas toxicidades pueden ocurrir tres meses o más después de la última dosis del inhibidor de puntos de control.', 'Yo tuve una de las primeras pacientes que traté con un inhibidor de puntos de control que recibió una dosis en un ensayo clínico, que tenía enfermedad progresiva.', 'Y tres meses después presentó diarrea potencialmente mortal por colitis.', 'Eso fue, por supuesto, antes de que supiéramos que podíamos identificarla pronto.', 'Así que indudablemente tienes que pensar en la toxicidad inmunitaria con casi cualquier efecto secundario.', 'Y bueno, mencioné que Impassion-130 mostró un beneficio con la adición de atezolizumab al nab-paclitaxel.', 'Es decir, usaron un fármaco acompañante para la quimioterapia.', 'Y la diferencia aquí, se puede ver en la supervivencia sin progresión media se observó solo en las pacientes que tenían enfermedad con positividad para las células inmunitarias PD-L1.', 'Usaron un anticuerpo SP142 y no una puntuación positiva combinada.', 'El anticuerpo con una puntuación positiva combinada es 22C3.', 'Les comentaré algo acerca de esto dentro de un momento.', 'Inicialmente, mostraron una mejora en la supervivencia global de alrededor de 6,3 meses.', 'Pero con el seguimiento a largo plazo, la diferencia es muy similar a la observada con pembrolizumab, como les acabo de mostrar con una mejora de 7 meses en la supervivencia global.', 'Como pueden ver, las pacientes sin taxanos previos parecen tener mejor cociente de riesgos instantáneos en la supervivencia global.', 'Probablemente debido al desarrollo de resistencia a lo largo del tiempo.', 'Pero es algo digno de mención.', 'Estos son los llamados análisis de referencia, y van del 22% al 36% a los 3 años cuando se sabe que la mediana de la supervivencia sigue siendo de solo unos 2 años.', 'Por lo tanto, hay un subgrupo de pacientes que de verdad se benefician enormemente de la inmunoterapia, pero en Impassion-130, solo el 40%, casi idéntico a KEYNOTE-355.', 'Entonces, lo que pasó con Impassion-130 es en realidad, creo, una lección muy importante para todos nosotros sobre diseño estadístico.', 'No me queda claro exactamente, a pesar de que formaba parte del comité de dirección, por qué tenían un plan de análisis estadístico predefinido jerárquico.', 'Por lo tanto, lo que dijeron fue que había que tener un beneficio en la población por intención de tratar en cuanto a la SSP y la SG con el fin de considerar el beneficio en el subgrupo de pacientes con enfermedad PD-L1+.', 'Así que, vieron un beneficio en la SSP y la intención de tratar, entonces pudieron continuar para demostrar que el beneficio era solo en las pacientes con PD-L1+.', 'Pero para la SG, como cabría esperar, no hubo diferencia en las pacientes de la población por intención de tratar porque solo el 40% eran PD-L1+.', 'Entonces, esto fue...', 'Se puede ver el beneficio, parece clínicamente muy importante, pero el diseño estadístico no permitió observar la supervivencia global en los pacientes PD-L1+, debido al análisis por intención de tratar.', 'Así que necesitaron un ensayo confirmatorio para tener la autorización plena.', 'Y el siguiente ensayo que hicieron, Impassion-131, no mostró un beneficio al agregar atezolizumab por razones muy poco claras, ya que vimos estos datos muy alentadores con pembrolizumab y datos alentadores en la enfermedad incipiente.', 'Por lo tanto, esto llevó a la retirada de la autorización acelerada del atezolizumab en los EE. UU. en la indicación de metástasis.', 'Hay un estudio en curso que sigue analizando el atezolizumab en la indicación de metástasis en un ensayo de fase III y no se retiró la autorización en otros países porque esto no era un requisito.', 'Fue de la FDA de los EE. UU. pero, ciertamente, creo que ha resultado en un menor uso del atezolizumab en este contexto.', 'Les muestro estos datos del otro ensayo, el Impassion-131, el ensayo negativo.', 'Este ensayo, como pueden ver, incluyó casi el mismo número de pacientes.', 'Y el PD-L1 era positivo en el 45%.', 'El paclitaxel fue el fármaco acompañante en lugar del nab-paclitaxel, pero se utilizaron corticoesteroides en el ensayo KEYNOTE-355 debido a la naturaleza de la quimioterapia.', 'Las pacientes no tratadas _de novo_ fueron algunas menos, pero similares a KEYNOTE-355, taxanos previos, de nuevo, un poco más y menos en KEYNOTE-355.', 'Es posible que estas diferencias, que no podemos entender realmente, hayan marcado la diferencia en cuanto a no mostrar ningún beneficio en la SSP.', 'Aquí, se puede ver que la SSP era idéntica, pero tampoco hubo beneficio en la supervivencia.', 'Y la supervivencia global en la población de pacientes que recibieron paclitaxel en solitario fue de 28 meses, mayor de lo que habíamos visto nunca antes.', 'Por lo tanto, se plantea la cuestión de si esta población de pacientes de verdad era o no biológicamente diferente y si deberíamos o no estar haciendo subtipificación intrínseca para conocer mejor el beneficio de la quimioterapia en estas pacientes.', 'Quiero parar aquí para recordarles a todos que pueden hacer preguntas y comentarios en cualquier momento.', 'Así que, cualquier cosa que surja, simplemente pongan algo en el recuadro de preguntas y respuestas.', 'Envíen sus preguntas y comentarios.', 'Queremos escucharlos y que nos digan lo que piensan.', 'Y no tiene por qué ser una pregunta.', 'Puede ser un comentario.', 'Así que espero recibir sus aportaciones.', 'Envíenlas mientras hablamos.', 'Entonces, ¿qué preguntas nos hacemos sobre el uso metastásico de los inhibidores de puntos de control?', 'Bueno, ¿por qué el PD-L1 solo es importante para la enfermedad metastásica?', 'Creemos que esto se debe a la supresión inmunitaria de la carga de morbimortalidad.', 'Es muy interesante que hayamos demostrado que el beneficio de los inhibidores de puntos de control es relativamente mayor en la enfermedad en estadio más alto y con afectación ganglionar en el estadio incipiente, donde el pembrolizumab neoadyuvante está aprobado ahora en los Estados Unidos a partir de los resultados del estudio KEYNOTE-522.', 'Así, sabemos que la carga de morbimortalidad se asocia con una menor probabilidad de respuesta patológica completa e incluso en pacientes de una RPC, un resultado relativamente algo peor.', 'Entonces, ¿podría ser que sea la carga de morbimortalidad?', 'Y sospecho que lo que estamos viendo aquí, y ha habido algunos estudios muy buenos que lo demuestran con muestras emparejadas, es una reducción de la expresión del PD-L1 y, lo que es más importante, una disminución de los linfocitos infiltrantes de tumores y un aumento de la complejidad mutacional que aumenta la resistencia a la quimioterapia y una reducción en el anfitrión, la capacidad del anfitrión de responder al tumor inmunitariamente.', 'Por lo tanto, el tumor, en realidad, cuanto mayor es la carga de morbimortalidad que se tiene, mejor es la capacidad del tumor para suprimir la respuesta inmunitaria del anfitrión.', 'El mejor fármaco acompañante de la quimioterapia, todavía...', 'Ya lo he mencionado, todavía elegiríamos el nab-paclitaxel si pudiéramos como fármaco acompañante de la quimioterapia y en pacientes que han recibido un taxano y tienen enfermedad resistente, gemcitabina y carboplatino.', 'Realmente no sabemos cuánto tiempo continuar con el inhibidor de puntos de control, así que tenemos pacientes que han tenido una respuesta excelente.', 'Y luego, detenemos la quimioterapia y continuamos con el inhibidor de puntos de control.', 'El KEYNOTE-355 suspendió el pembrolizumab a los 2 años, atezolizumab continuó el inhibidor de puntos de control.', 'Así que no sabemos y sabemos que puede haber más toxicidad inmunitaria cuanto más larga sea la exposición.', 'Y luego, por supuesto, unas cuantas pacientes se benefician relativamente en una población clínica real.', 'Podría ser solo el 30% o así.', 'Tenemos que buscar nuevas combinaciones y tratar de mejorar la efectividad de los inhibidores de puntos de control.', 'Y también estamos extendiendo los inhibidores de puntos de control a otros subgrupos de la enfermedad como la enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales.', 'Y la gran pregunta es ¿qué subgrupos debemos incluir y cómo debemos identificarlos?', 'No estoy segura de que los ensayos aleatorizados de fase III estén identificando la población correcta.', 'Así que ya veremos.', 'Y luego, hay muchos ensayos y el entorno neoadyuvante, post-neoadyuvante y metastásico que analizan los inhibidores de puntos de control en la enfermedad HER2+.', 'A la derecha, les muestro que las pruebas que se hacen para determinar la positividad del PD-L1 son realmente importantes, y esa también era una pregunta constante.', 'Aquí, pueden ver que en el ensayo Impassion-130, pudimos demostrar que había cierta superposición en la positividad con SP142 y la CPS.', 'Pero creo que, por otro lado, hubo muchas pacientes que tuvieron enfermedad positiva solo por SP142 o 22C3 usando el punto de corte de la CPS de 10.', 'Entonces, es muy interesante.', 'Y ahora he visto algunas pacientes que inicialmente tenían un SP142 que era 0 y tienen una CPS de 50.', 'Entonces, este es realmente un verdadero problema, y estoy segura de que veremos lo contrario también.', 'No estamos haciendo SP142 ahora en los Estados Unidos.', 'Hay muchos estudios diferentes que están investigando cómo amplificar la respuesta inmunitaria.', 'Les acabo de mostrar algunos.', 'Terapia de inducción para tratar de mejorar la respuesta inmunitaria del anfitrión con poca quimioterapia o radioterapia.', 'Hay un ensayo de fase II en curso que analiza la inducción con doxorubicina tomando como base la respuesta más alta que se muestra aquí con una pequeña dosis de inducción de doxorubicina y luego nivolumab en monoterapia.', 'Estamos usando la inducción en un ensayo financiado por la BCRF, la Breast Cancer Research Foundation, con varios agentes diferentes, un inhibidor de MEK, el CAF sacituzumab govitecán y doxorubicina liposomal.', 'Sabemos que potencia la respuesta inmunitaria en el contexto neoadyuvante.', 'Y luego lo combinamos con el inhibidor de puntos de control avelumab después de una inducción de 2 semanas.', 'Y Sara Tolaney y Ana Garrido-Castro están estudiando el sacituzumab en monoterapia o en combinación con pembrolizumab como tratamiento de primera línea en pacientes con cáncer de mama triple negativo metastásico, así como con enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales.', 'En San Antonio se obtuvieron datos interesantes de pacientes que recibían combinaciones de inmunoterapia y que presentaban una elevada carga mutacional tumoral o una enfermedad metastásica con HER2– hipermutada.', 'Pero es interesante señalar que la mayoría de estas pacientes tienen cáncer lobulillar.', 'Y repito, es muy importante tener esto en cuenta.', 'Se están llevando a cabo estudios sobre combinaciones con inhibidores de la PARP que podrían potenciar la respuesta inmunitaria y la radioterapia que creo que serán muy importantes para nosotros en el futuro.', 'Este es un ejemplo de los datos previos.', 'Es decir, los datos complementarios del estudio de un inhibidor de puntos de control en la enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales.', 'Se trataba de pacientes que tenían enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales con amplios antecedentes terapéuticos con PD-L1 positivo a las que les administramos pembrolizumab en monoterapia.', 'La respuesta global fue del 12%.', 'El número de pacientes era escaso, solo 25, pero las respuestas fueron muy duraderas en las que respondieron.', 'Y esto pueden verlo aquí en este gráfico de barras y luego en el gráfico de espagueti aquí donde pueden ver las pacientes que tuvieron una respuesta.', 'Realmente era bastante duradera.', 'Así que creo que es muy interesante.', 'Ahora combinamos los inhibidores de puntos de control con quimioterapia porque sabemos que la quimioterapia potencia la respuesta inmunitaria.', 'Este es el ensayo KEYNOTE-B49 en curso, del cual soy la IP estadounidense, y Peter Schmid es el IP europeo.', 'Las pacientes pueden recibir de nuevo un régimen de quimioterapia que incluya paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, doxorubicina liposomal o capecitabina junto con pembrolizumab.', 'Y luego, para ser elegibles, las pacientes deben tener enfermedad PD-L1+.', 'Así que, esperamos que con esto se pueda esquivar el hecho de que no se está dividiendo al grupo de pacientes por criterios biológicos como por ejemplo pacientes que tienen más enfermedad luminal B, enfermedad con más resistencia endocrina.', 'Y el punto de corte de la CPS es uno.', 'Por lo tanto, tendremos que buscar un CPS de 10 o más en el análisis final como se muestra aquí.', 'Así que, este ensayo, por supuesto, está reclutando pacientes, aunque lentamente, porque el número de pacientes que son CPS positivas y que tienen enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales es pequeño y no hemos descubierto exactamente cómo identificarlas.', 'Pero esperemos que esto mejore con el tiempo.', 'Los conjugados de anticuerpo y fármaco son una nueva área realmente apasionante.', 'El conjugado de anticuerpo y fármaco sacituzumab govitecán es un anticuerpo Trop-2 con el metabolito activo del irinotecán unido y con un elevado cociente fármaco-anticuerpo.', 'Entonces, la toxina es SN-38, lo cual es estupendo porque estás suministrando la toxina directamente a la célula cancerosa con un conjugado de anticuerpo y fármaco.', 'También se produce algo llamado efecto espectador o de vecindad, que es algo muy interesante, y significa que incluso los tumores que no expresan la diana del anticuerpo pueden ser destruidos.', 'Algunos CAF producen un mejor efecto de vecindad que otros y es algo que no entendemos bien.', 'Tampoco entendemos la toxicidad de los CAF.', 'Realmente no podemos medir la toxina en la sangre, pero aún vemos toxicidades relacionadas con la toxina con todos los CAF de nueva generación mucho más que trastuzumab emtansina.', 'Con sacituzumab, vemos más neutropenia.', 'Aproximadamente el 50% de las pacientes necesitó factores de crecimiento, pero casi ninguna paciente suspendió el tratamiento debido a acontecimientos adversos.', 'Así que se puede controlar casi toda la toxicidad bien y la diarrea, se puede manejar bastante bien.', '10% de grado 3, pero con antidiarreicos y reducción de la dosis, es fácil de controlar.', 'El primer análisis del ensayo ASCENT que se muestra aquí demostró una mejora en la supervivencia sin progresión y en la supervivencia global que fue estadísticamente significativa en pacientes con amplios antecedentes terapéuticos con enfermedad triple negativa.', 'O sea, los datos son muy interesantes y esto estableció el sacituzumab como una nueva opción de tratamiento en la segunda línea o posterior para el cáncer de mama triple negativo.', 'Pero, por supuesto, las pacientes siguen muriendo de cáncer y como pueden ver aquí, la mediana de la supervivencia global fue de 12,1 meses en estas pacientes en las que la mediana del número de líneas previas de tratamiento fue de tres a cuatro.', 'Entonces, ¿qué más podemos hacer?', 'Bueno, estamos evaluando otros CAF y luego, podemos pasar estos fármacos, por supuesto, a la enfermedad en estadio incipiente.', 'El datopotamab deruxtecán es un CAF Trop-2 que les mostraré dentro de un momento.', 'Y luego, el ladiratuzumab vedotina se dirige contra LIV1A, ese es el anticuerpo, pero la toxina provoca neuropatía.', 'Aún se está evaluando con diferentes esquemas posológicos.', 'El trastuzumab deruxtecán, por supuesto, se está evaluando en la enfermedad con HER2 bajo.', 'Una vez más, hablaré sobre esto dentro de un momento.', 'Y luego hay un CAF de HER3 que tiene el estado de tecnología innovadora de la FDA de los EE. UU. para el cáncer de pulmón no microcítico con eGFR mutado.', 'Hay varios ensayos de fase III de los que hablaremos en un momento.', 'Y luego, nuevas vías en combinación con inmunoterapia que, creo, son muy interesantes también.', 'Este ensayo con el datopotamab deruxtecán ya está abierto y reclutando, el TROPION-Breast01 en el cáncer de mama con positividad para receptores hormonales y ese ensayo en la enfermedad triple negativa se abrirá más adelante este año.', 'Solo tenemos datos, es interesante, con Dato-Dxd en enfermedad triple negativa pero esperamos ver enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales en ASCO.', 'Estos datos se actualizaron en San Antonio en 2021 y mostraron unas tasas de respuesta muy buenas en este pequeño número de pacientes y en las pacientes que no habían recibido previamente un CAF basado en inhibidores de la topoisomerasa I, la tasa de respuesta fue superior al 50%.', 'Pero repito, esto es solo en 27 pacientes.', 'Y pueden ver que las respuestas fueron notablemente duraderas con este conjugado de anticuerpo y fármaco.', 'Lo interesante de este CAF es que la proporción fármaco-anticuerpo para trastuzumab deruxtecán y sacituzumab es de 7 y medio a 8.', 'Para este, son como 4.', 'Pero la toxicidad es completamente diferente.', 'Parece muy efectivo, pero hubo muchas náuseas, cosa que vemos con el trastuzumab deruxtecán.', 'Así que creo que esta es la toxina.', 'Pero vieron mucha estomatitis y el 10% era de grado 3.', 'Así que no tenemos idea de por qué es así, ya que esto no lo hemos visto con ningún otro CAF que use deruxtecán como toxina.', 'El HER2-bajo es un campo muy interesante y en la actualidad, se ha vuelto aún más apasionante.', 'Esta es una definición extraña, no es claramente una definición biológicamente relevante, pero todavía se definió basándose en un estudio de fase I inicial con trastuzumab deruxtecán.', 'Por lo tanto, el HER2-bajo tiene una mayor prevalencia en la enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales que en la enfermedad triple negativa, del 65% frente al 37%.', 'Se define como ser 1+ o 2+ por inmunohistoquímica para HER2– y no amplificado por hibridación _in situ_.', 'Así, se puede ver que esto también se divide en luminal A, luminal B, HER2 enriquecido y similar a basal.', 'Y lo que pueden ver es que una vez que tienes IHQ 1 y 2+ no amplificada, se ven relativamente menos similares al basal en comparación con IHQ 0, y se ve una expansión de luminal B. Es decir, aquí es donde realmente está todo este grupo.', 'La mayoría de estas pacientes tienen enfermedad luminal A y B, lo cual es interesante porque, por supuesto, es una cohorte con positividad para receptores hormonales.', 'Hay varios ensayos en curso.', 'El DESTINY-Breast06, hay ensayos que están analizando la comparación con la quimioterapia de elección del médico.', 'Hay uno de disitamab vedotina que también está analizando la enfermedad HER2-bajo que está dirigido a HER2.', 'Pero el DESTINY-Breast04, que es un ensayo de fase III que aleatorizó a pacientes que tenían HER2-bajo definido centralmente, un cáncer de mama metastásico que limitó el número de pacientes con enfermedad triple negativa.', 'Las pacientes fueron aleatorizadas en proporción 2 a 1 para recibir trastuzumab deruxtecán o quimioterapia de elección del médico, y los números se exponen aquí.', 'Pueden ver el número total de pacientes del ensayo, 360 frente a 180.', 'El criterio principal de valoración: fue la SSP, los criterios secundarios de valoración, la supervivencia global y, por supuesto, la respuesta y la duración de la respuesta.', 'Nosotros participamos en este ensayo que permitía incluir pacientes que habían recibido hasta dos líneas previas de quimioterapia y habían agotado sus opciones de tratamiento endocrino.', 'Hoy hubo un comunicado de prensa de AstraZeneca y Daiichi Sankyo, que colaboraron juntos en este fármaco, que tiene el nombre comercial de Enhertu y acabo de copiar y pegar el comunicado de prensa, así que aparece un nombre comercial aquí.', 'Pero se demostró que hubo una mejora no solo en la supervivencia sin progresión, sino también en la supervivencia global.', 'Y esto demuestra una mejora estadísticamente significativa, y por supuesto, clínicamente trascendente, en la SSP y la SG en la enfermedad HER2-bajo, la enfermedad metastásica en primera o segunda línea, supongo, en segunda o tercera línea.', 'Entonces, dicen con independencia del estado de los receptores hormonales.', 'Así que deben haber visto esto tanto en el grupo de triple negativo como en el grupo con positividad para receptores hormonales.', 'Es decir, datos muy, muy interesantes que veremos en ASCO este año, pero que cambiarán la forma en que tratamos a las pacientes con enfermedad metastásica, creo, en un futuro no muy lejano, dependiendo de la disponibilidad de los fármacos.', 'También resalto el hecho de que el sacituzumab govitecán se probó en la enfermedad metastásica con positividad para receptores hormonales con hasta más líneas de tratamiento.', 'O sea, tenías que recibir al menos dos líneas de quimioterapia y hasta cinco.', 'Es decir, con antecedentes terapéuticos más amplios en comparación con la quimioterapia de elección del médico.', 'Estos datos se presentarán en la ASCO, pero aún no están disponibles para nosotros, aunque deberían estarlo en un futuro próximo.', 'Y bueno, repito, preguntas, en cualquier momento, si tienen comentarios.', 'Todavía no veo nada en el recuadro de comentarios pero por favor siéntanse libres de poner comentarios en el recuadro de preguntas y respuestas y preguntas en cualquier momento.', 'Y bueno, las metástasis cerebrales son claramente una necesidad clínica por cubrir.', 'Es una localización frecuente de la enfermedad metastásica, hasta el 50% de las pacientes con cáncer de mama HER2+, hasta el 50% con enfermedad metastásica triple negativa y a menudo conduce a una muerte rápida en el cáncer de mama triple negativo.', 'Y luego, en la enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales, vemos más metástasis cerebrales porque nuestras pacientes viven más y tenemos mejores opciones de tratamiento.', 'Parece aumentar en pacientes que tienen mutaciones en PIK3CA y en aproximadamente la mitad de las pacientes que tienen mutaciones de BRCA en la línea germinal.', 'Se puede ver en pacientes, como, muy doloroso, que tienen una enfermedad sistémica muy bien controlada.', 'Podemos ver una progresión inexorable continua en el encéfalo y después, desarrollo de enfermedad leptomeníngea con el tiempo.', 'Y aquí pueden ver este realce de las leptomeninges también en esta paciente.', 'La recidiva después de la radiación es frecuente y la toxicidad por radiación es limitante para las pacientes.', 'Y, por supuesto, debido a la barrera hematoencefálica que no entendemos bien, hay una exposición limitada a los citotóxicos.', 'Y la mayoría de los ensayos, hasta hace muy poco, excluían a las pacientes con metástasis cerebrales.', 'Vimos, a pesar de que mejoramos notablemente el resultado para la enfermedad HER2+ que incluso cuando dimos a pacientes con enfermedad residual T-DM1 o el conjugado de anticuerpo y fármaco frente al trastuzumab y se demostró una gran mejoría en las pacientes que están en riesgo de recidiva a distancia que todavía había un riesgo continuado de enfermedad del SNC que no se modificó.', 'Esto muestra que la recidiva a distancia mejoró mucho desde el ensayo KATHERINE con T-DM1 pero no hay diferencias en el desarrollo de metástasis en el SNC.', 'Esto despertó mucho interés por tratar de entender cómo podríamos mejorar el resultado.', 'Hay varias combinaciones diferentes de quimioterapia que han mostrado una eficacia limitada en pacientes con metástasis cerebrales resistentes.', 'Pero son generalmente de corta duración con la excepción de algunos estudios pequeños, bevacizumab, cisplatino, etopósido en 35 pacientes, por ejemplo.', 'Donde hemos visto más mejoría es en terapias dirigidas a HER2, no con estos grupos, pero vimos algunas respuestas.', 'Incluso lo vemos con trastuzumab emtansina o T-DM1 donde hubo una tasa de respuesta en 10 pacientes del 30%.', 'Siguen siendo números pequeños pero aun así alentadores.', 'Ahora vamos a hablar sobre algunos de los datos que tenemos.', 'Por ejemplo, examinamos el abemaciclib como una colaboración en pacientes que tenían metástasis cerebrales. Lilly y Sara Tolaney publicaron estos datos en 2020 mostrando respuestas muy limitadas en pacientes con metástasis cerebrales.', 'Vemos estas supervivencias más largas en pacientes que tienen enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales.', 'Esta es la cohorte con positividad para receptores hormonales y HER2–, con una tasa de respuesta del 5,2%, solo 3 pacientes de 58 pero la tasa de beneficio clínico intracraneal fue del 24%.', 'Por lo tanto, aunque no alcanzaron su criterio principal de valoración en las pacientes con enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales y metástasis cerebrales, solemos elegir el abemaciclib como inhibidor de CDK4/6 acompañante del tratamiento endocrino.', 'Vieron mucho abemaciclib en el LCR, una evaluación interesante, donde estudiaron los analitos de abemaciclib.', 'Poca respuesta en la enfermedad HER2+ y la enfermedad leptomeníngea.', 'De nuevo, vieron una respuesta pero fue de corta duración en estas pacientes, y solo se incluyeron 10 pacientes.', 'El neratinib y la capecitabina se han estudiado en pacientes con enfermedad HER2+.', 'Rachel Freedman publicó estos datos en el JCO.', 'Y pueden ver que de hecho había una tasa de respuesta del SNC bastante buena, del 49%.', 'Y si miran el... esto es mirando la respuesta volumétrica.', 'Si miran la suma de los diámetros mayores, es del 24%.', 'Así que sigue siendo bastante bueno comparado con lo que vimos antes.', 'Nueve respuestas y tendieron a ser más duraderas mientras las pacientes continuaban con el tratamiento.', 'Lamentablemente, esta combinación provoca mucha diarrea, pero sigue siendo una opción de tratamiento, aunque no sin la autorización reglamentaria.', 'Y luego vimos estos datos, que sí tienen la autorización reglamentaria, añadir tucatinib a trastuzumab y capecitabina en pacientes que han progresado con todas las terapias disponibles.', 'Trastuzumab, pertuzumab y trastuzumab emtansina.', 'Observaron una mejoría de la supervivencia sin progresión en las 291 pacientes con metástasis cerebrales.', 'Y este ensayo permitió que las pacientes continuaran, que tenían metástasis cerebrales activas, para las que las pacientes no necesitaban tratamiento inmediato.', 'Así que fue muy alentador.', 'Y aquí, pueden ver que no fue solo la supervivencia sin progresión sino la supervivencia global lo que mejoró en pacientes con metástasis cerebrales.', 'Y he administrado tucatinib a dos pacientes que tenían metástasis cerebrales progresivas a pesar de la radiación y que realmente no pueden recibir más radiación.', 'Una de las pacientes no tuvo una buena respuesta pero sospecho que era una necrosis por radiación que no, no fue leída aprop., no pudimos saber.', 'Pero la otra paciente que tiene múltiples metástasis cerebrales quísticas y que básicamente habría pasado a cuidados paliativos, por el contrario se sometió a este régimen triple de HER2CLIMB y ahora, todavía tiene respuesta continuada de la enfermedad 8 meses después de comenzar esta terapia.', 'Y es realmente extraordinario.', 'Cada RM cerebral secuencial muestra respuesta al tratamiento.', 'Así es que, es muy emocionante.', 'El DESTINY-Breast03 también examinó a pacientes que tenían metástasis cerebrales al inicio pero tenían que estar controladas.', 'Entonces, es un poco diferente.', 'Sara Hurvitz presentó estos datos en San Antonio este año.', 'Y aquí se muestran los antecedentes de las metástasis cerebrales o metástasis cerebrales al inicio con datos en ese grupo.', 'Y es interesante porque en este ensayo se analizó el trastuzumab deruxtecán frente al T-DM1.', 'Es decir, T-DXd frente al T-DM1, y pueden ver que hubo una marcada mejoría en la mediana de la supervivencia sin progresión usando T-DXd y la tasa de SSP a 12 meses con un cociente de riesgos instantáneos de 0,25 si había metástasis cerebrales al inicio.', 'Parece que puede haber efectividad en esa población de pacientes.', 'Se está evaluado ahora.', 'Por lo tanto, esta es una evaluación en curso.', 'Las tasas de respuesta intracraneal se muestran aquí en pacientes con metástasis cerebrales.', 'En realidad miran a ver si las metástasis cerebrales se han reducido aún más.', 'Ahora bien, no se pueden eliminar los efectos a largo plazo de la radiación pero aun así, esa mejora espectacular, casi el doble, es muy alentadora.', 'Aquí se muestra la respuesta intracraneal, otra vez, usando los criterios RECIST 1.1.', 'Y pueden ver que es mucho mejor para T-DM1 en comparación con T-DXd.', 'En realidad, quería mencionar algo que es importante considerar en las metástasis cerebrales y es que hay gente piensa que RECIST quizás no sea la mejor forma o la respuesta volumétrica.', 'Así que, los criterios de respuesta RANO son una forma de analizar la respuesta volumétrica.', 'Y se muestra cómo se usan las lesiones indicadoras con respuesta completa, respuesta parcial y enfermedad estable.', 'Estudiar esto es realmente muy útil e incluye la respuesta volumétrica, que creo que es muy útil.', 'Publicado en 2015.', 'Bien, de nuevo, veo que hay un par de preguntas, que responderemos en un momento porque estamos a punto de terminar.', 'Creo que hay un área muy importante creo que hay un área muy importante, prevenir el deterioro cognitivo.', 'Con la radiación a lo largo del tiempo, una y otra vez, la radiación estereotáctica en el encéfalo completo. La radiación estereotáctica en el encéfalo completo.', 'Y presentan...', 'Algunas de estas pacientes tienen una terrible disfunción cognitiva que contribuye a su muerte.', 'La memantina en un ensayo aleatorizado de fase III mostró un tiempo hasta el deterioro cognitivo significativamente mayor.', 'Si se toma memantina durante la radioterapia en el encéfalo completo y la mayoría de las pacientes continúa tomándola y luego, la técnica de radiación alterada es el intento más reciente para reducir los efectos a largo plazo es el intento más reciente para reducir los efectos a largo plazo. Y la añadimos a la radioterapia en el encéfalo completo, entonces básicamente tratamos de preservar el hipocampo entonces básicamente tratamos de evitar la radiación del hipocampo usando la radioterapia de intensidad modulada.', 'Y en realidad, hubo una reducción significativa en el riesgo de fallo cognitivo y menos deterioro a los 4 y 6 meses tanto en la función ejecutiva como en el aprendizaje en la memoria. Así, esto se ha convertido en estándar para la radioterapia en el encéfalo completo al menos en nuestra institución.', 'Y por último, la enfermedad leptomeníngea es un área terrible para la progresión del cáncer de mama.', 'Estos son datos más antiguos, estos son datos más antiguos, pero noto que los estamos viendo con mucha más frecuencia ahora.', 'Se ve más en la histología lobulillar y el 35% de las pacientes con enfermedad leptomeníngea tienen histología lobulillar así como enfermedad triple negativa.', 'Y la esperanza de vida después del diagnóstico tiende a ser muy corta a menos que sea en el momento del diagnóstico inicial. Por lo general, el diagnóstico se hace revisando el LCR. El diagnóstico se hace revisando el LCR. Y buscamos otras maneras de hacer el diagnóstico de ELM en pacientes que tienen síntomas en esas células usando ácido desoxirribonucleico libre.', 'Se ha administrado tratamiento por vía intratecal con metotrexato, pero se están evaluando nuevos caminos, por resultados algo decepcionantes del trastuzumab intratecal.', 'Y la radiación se usa de antemano para lesiones voluminosas.', 'Hay varios estudios diferentes que están siendo, tratamientos que se han evaluado.', 'En mi opinión algunos de los más interesantes eran usar pembrolizumab o nivolumab i.v. o intratecal, lo cual es muy interesante.', 'Y hay un informe de un caso de uno de nuestros colegas principales que analizaba la administración intratecal de un inhibidor de puntos de control al melanoma y demostró esta reducción drástica de la enfermedad en una paciente con ELM.', 'Hay un fármaco muy interesante, el paclitaxel conjugado con angiopep-2 que actúa en un receptor llamado LRP1 en la barrera hematoencefálica que está aumentado en tumores encefálicos.', 'Y esta actuación facilita la transcitosis mediada por receptores a través de la barrera hematoencefálica.', 'Tienen algunos resultados preliminares muy interesantes y han tenido algunos problemas cuando la empresa ha sido adquirida por otra y el desarrollo de medicamentos.', 'Pero espero que pronto veamos todo esto en un ensayo clínico.', 'Y luego mis colegas y otros estudian el ácido desoxirribonucleico libre y el LCR para caracterizar el entorno inmunitario y buscar posibles dianas quizás también para una detección temprana.', 'También, la terapia de secuenciación.', 'Les mostraré esto cuando terminemos aquí.', 'En la enfermedad PD-L1+, usamos pembrolizumab, elección de quimioterapia basada en el tiempo desde la última terapia, inhibidores de PARP en pacientes que tienen mutaciones de BRCA en la línea germinal y tal vez en aquellas que presentan mutaciones somáticas adquiridas de BRCA.', 'Con BRCA no mutado, realmente no tenemos grandes opciones más que la quimioterapia y el conjugado de anticuerpo y fármaco sacituzumab.', 'Tal vez también tendremos el trastuzumab deruxtecán en un futuro próximo.', 'Y luego, para la carga mutacional tumoral elevada y mucha inestabilidad de microsatélites, se puede usar pembrolizumab teniendo en cuenta la autorización en EE. UU.', 'Depende de dónde esté aprobado.', 'Y el atezolizumab todavía está aprobado en muchos lugares del mundo.', 'Para la enfermedad con positividad de receptores hormonales, esto es como una pequeña diapositiva, pero de nuestra actualización de la directriz de ASCO, básicamente, la recomendación de todas las directrices es que se usen inhibidores de CDK4/6 como tratamiento de primera línea, preferiblemente en combinación con un inhibidor de la aromatasa a menos que una paciente ya haya recibido un IA y haya desarrollado enfermedad metastásica, en cuyo caso, que se muestra aquí, se optaría por fulvestrant.', 'Pero de lo contrario, creo que ahora mismo, preferimos reservar el fulvestrant para el tratamiento de segunda línea en combinación con alpelisib o everólimus en función del estado mutacional de PIK3CA.', 'Y controlar la toxicidad de esos fármacos es otra área que nos quita el sueño.', 'Y luego, por supuesto, se puede usar tamoxifeno.', 'No sabemos lo que hacen las CDK después de los inhibidores de CDK4/6, y hay mucho interés en esa área también, cómo usar tratamiento endocrino como tercera línea.', 'Hay un montón de trabajos en curso con reductores orales selectivos de los receptores de estrógenos y nuevos tratamientos endocrinos como los moduladores de los receptores de andrógenos que creo que nos darán muchas más opciones en el futuro que podremos usar en pacientes que recibieron un inhibidor de CDK4/6 en el contexto adyuvante donde ahora tendremos una cuestión adicional sobre cómo tratar a esas pacientes.', 'Me saltaré esta y pasaré a la enfermedad metastásica con HER2+ en la que hemos progresado mucho con el trastuzumab deruxtecán y con la pauta de tucatinib HER2CLIMB, lo que realmente ha cambiado nuestra secuenciación del tratamiento.', 'Y ahora, vamos a tener que pensar en el trastuzumab deruxtecán en pacientes que tienen enfermedad con HER2-bajo también.', 'Por último, la toxicidad económica es realmente un gran problema para nuestras pacientes y puede provocar el incumplimiento o el rechazo del tratamiento.', 'La gente pierde el trabajo.', 'Además, mueren antes si no reciben tratamiento.', 'Y este es un problema enorme.', 'Tenemos pacientes que no vienen para su tratamiento porque no tienen quien cuide a sus hijos o no pueden pagar sus medicamentos.', 'Y ese es un problema gravísimo, y es un tema muy candente en todo el mundo.', 'Ciertamente no lo hemos resuelto porque la cuestión económica es un problema para los pacientes en todas las áreas de la vida.', 'Y creo que es solo... abordar las dificultades económicas es muy importante cuando empezamos a tratar pacientes con cáncer de mama.', 'Así que terminaré solamente enumerando los otros temas de debate y pasaré el testigo a Olivia y les mostraré la guía de Consenso para el Cáncer de Mama Avanzado en la última reunión en persona.', 'En noviembre de este año tendremos un mini congreso en Lisboa y los animamos a todos a escucharlo o asistir si pueden.', 'Gracias, Hope.', 'Muy exhaustivo.', 'Y sí, realmente muy interesante, y también, genera muchas preguntas.', 'Tenemos dos preguntas de Simona.', 'La primera es, en pacientes con enfermedad leptomeníngea RH+, HER2–, ¿recomendaría el inhibidor de CDK4 o quimioterapia?', 'Y en caso afirmativo, ¿prefiere algún régimen?', 'Bueno, creo que depende mucho del volumen de enfermedad leptomeníngea que tengan.', 'Es decir, algunas pacientes no tienen síntomas y presentan cierto engrosamiento leptomeníngeo en las imágenes.', 'En estas pacientes, tiendo a tratarlas como si no tuvieran ELM y usaré... ...generalmente estas pacientes tienen la enfermedad en el propio SNC.', 'Entonces, yo trato con radioterapia y luego las trataría como si no tuvieran ELM.', 'Una de mis pacientes en realidad vivió casi cinco años y presentó inicialmente cáncer lobulillar bilateral, enfermedad leptomeníngea así como algunas metástasis encefálicas.', 'Y estaba bien sin recidiva de la enfermedad leptomeníngea y esta realmente no volvió a aparecer hasta mucho más tarde en el curso de la enfermedad.', 'Pero para la mayoría de las pacientes, este no es el caso y son sintomáticas.', 'Y lo que hago es inicialmente tratar con radiación y nuestros radiooncólogos también lo hacen.', 'A menos que la enfermedad se extienda y se quiera hacer una resonancia de la columna.', 'Entonces, observamos el encéfalo y luego la columna vertebral.', 'Si sufren la enfermedad en el encéfalo completo y la columna no se puede irradiar todo.', 'Así que, entonces yo aplico tratamiento intratecal con metotrexato.', 'Y luego, para la quimioterapia sistémica, intentamos usar los fármacos que atraviesan la barrera hematoencefálica.', 'O sea, capecitabina.', 'El etopósido no está aprobado para el cáncer de mama, pero uno de mis colegas que está muy interesado en esto ha administrado una combinación de cisplatino y etopósido con muy buenos resultados en un pequeño número de pacientes.', 'Realmente depende de en qué medida responden a la quimioterapia las células cancerosas que han invadido las leptomeninges y cómo es la enfermedad sistémica y lo sintomática que es la paciente.', 'Y cuántas líneas reciben, si es la primera recidiva o no.', 'Y de nuevo Simona, considera la invasión de la médula ósea como una crisis visceral y por lo tanto, ¿recomienda la quimioterapia o se puede usar un CDK4/6 en pacientes con cáncer de mama luminal y metastásico?', 'Bueno, creo que...', 'Es una pregunta interesante porque la mayoría de nuestras pacientes con metástasis óseas presentan invasión medular.', 'Así que lo que considero una crisis visceral es pancitopenia.', 'Una paciente viene con plaquetas de 65.', 'Esa es una crisis visceral y, de hecho, en la mayoría de esas pacientes, si ellas en realidad, es decir, una de mis pacientes actuales que desarrolló enfermedad metastásica después de múltiples líneas de tratamiento endocrino porque tuvo recidivas locales y progresó con fulvestrant y abemaciclib con pancitopenia.', 'Y es interesante, no se puede ver el cáncer tan bien en las imágenes pero las plaquetas cayeron a 65 000 y presenta anemia dependiente de transfusiones.', 'Y en ese caso, realmente opino que solo la quimioterapia puede cambiar la situación.', 'Y lo que haré es empezar con una dosis muy baja de taxanos si puedo.', 'Esta paciente rechazó el taxano, así que le di capecitabina y estoy conteniendo la respiración para ver si sus recuentos de células suben.', 'Pero he administrado dosis muy bajas de taxanos en este contexto y he tenido pacientes recuperadas.', 'Pero entonces, lo que hago es detener la quimio y no en esta paciente que mencioné.', 'Tiene una enfermedad con resistencia endocrina.', 'Pero en otras pacientes, si es una paciente que todavía tiene sensibilidad endocrina, comenzaría el tratamiento endocrino después de conseguir que los recuentos se normalicen y lo intentaría y lo usaría como un descanso de la quimioterapia.', 'Sí, creo que un colega mío tiene una paciente que está respondiendo muy bien a la quimioterapia metronómica, es decir, capecitabina y porque ella no quería una dosis completa.', 'Así que creo que, en general, es una situación muy difícil de manejar.', 'Se desarrollan con mucha rapidez y progresan con mucha rapidez.', 'A ver, creo que aún tenemos un par de minutos para hacer preguntas.', 'Y solo por...', 'Hay una en el chat.', 'Ha entrado una nueva en el chat, Olivia.', 'Ah, hemos recibido una, bien.', 'Elena, sí, lo siento.', 'Para el cáncer de mama metastásico con positividad de HER2 con metástasis encefálicas, ¿qué recomienda como segunda línea si el trastuzumab deruxtecán no está aprobado o disponible?', 'Bueno, de hecho, en esta situación, si tienes todos los fármacos disponibles, usaríamos tucatinib, capecitabina y trastuzumab como segunda línea debido a los beneficios en la supervivencia global tan sorprendentes observados en pacientes con metástasis encefálicas.', 'Creo que T-DXd si lo tienes no sería una mala opción, pero creo que la mayoría de nosotros usaría tucatinib en ese contexto.', 'Y si hay una pequeña metástasis cerebral que está progresando, no importa mucho.', 'Si hay una gran cantidad de ellas y hay que irradiar el encéfalo completo o si ya han recibido radiación con cierta progresión menor, se consideraría, se considera el régimen de tucatinib HER2CLIMB.', 'Ahora, digamos que no tienes ninguno de estos fármacos nuevos tan caros y el tucatinib es bastante caro a pesar de ser un comprimido, y muy difícil para las pacientes que no tienen cobertura total del seguro.', 'Y si el trastuzumab deruxtecán no está aprobado.', 'El T-DM1 de hecho ha demostrado beneficios en metástasis encefálicas.', 'O sea, sin duda se ve una reducción.', 'Si es una paciente que tiene metástasis encefálicas en progresión en la segunda línea, se podría considerar el neratinib y la capecitabina donde hubo datos del ensayo NALA que demostraban cierta reducción.', 'Lo mostré en uno de mis resúmenes y también en los datos combinados donde se vio un control de la enfermedad más prolongado en pacientes con metástasis encefálicas tratadas y controladas.', 'Entonces, esta sería una opción.', 'Pero repito, creo que incluso la capecitabina con trastuzumab no es una opción poco razonable si una paciente ya ha recibido T-DM1 y no se dispone de ninguno de los otros fármacos.', 'El lapatinib también demostró beneficios en las metástasis encefálicas, pero es el más débil de los inhibidores orales de tirosina-cinasas que bloquean HER2 y la TFGe.', 'Así que usaría neratinib antes del lapatinib, si no pudiera, solo reduciría la dosis, usaría un esquema de aumento escalonado de dosis y usaría la dosis más baja posible para evitar mucha diarrea.', 'Y solo para completar esto.', '¿Cree que al menos en la enfermedad HER2+, dados los beneficios de estos fármacos, cambiaría la recomendación de no cribar las metástasis encefálicas?', '¿O cree que deberíamos revisar nuestra recomendación, al menos en la enfermedad HER2+?', 'Sí, saben, acabo de mencionar esto donde tenemos algunos casos para presentar en una conferencia local y la persona que los preparó, dijo: «Sabe, de verdad que debería hacer esta pregunta porque creo que la gente está cambiando».', 'Aunque nuestras directrices aún no recomiendan hacer pruebas de imagen cerebral de cribado y el grupo de Consenso para el Cáncer de Mama Avanzado no lo recomendó, hubo mucha gente que votó a favor.', 'Así que no hubo en modo alguno un acuerdo universal.', 'Y creo que debido a que ahora tenemos tratamiento y que a veces se ve una enfermedad muy muy mala donde la gente tiene muchos síntomas y hay que irradiar un área mucho más grande.', 'Creo que estamos cambiando hacia resonancias cerebrales de cribado periódicas.', 'La cuestión es que no tenemos idea de con qué frecuencia hacerlo y qué hacer, así que todavía estamos un poco perdidos en esa área.', 'Sin embargo, creo haber visto alguna disfunción cognitiva muy significativa en las pacientes con el tiempo y la necrosis por radiación, que es un problema enorme, enorme, un área enorme para abordar.', 'Si estuviéramos dando una charla sobre metástasis encefálicas, hablaríamos también de la necrosis por radiación porque es un tema muy importante que te quita el sueño.', 'Pero en esas pacientes, si solo irradiáramos áreas más pequeñas, tal vez, tendríamos menos toxicidad.', 'Así que esa es la, creo, las áreas a las que todavía tenemos que responder pero tal vez deberíamos hacer el cribado en algunas pacientes.', 'Bueno, creo que no hay más preguntas, tal vez, solo un comentario porque acabas de tocar quizás, creo que es importante sobre los inhibidores de PARP en pacientes con mutación BRCA.', 'Entonces, tal vez solo hacer un resumen sobre el manejo de estas mujeres de acuerdo con su subtipo porque creo que esto también es importante.', 'Sí, creo que es muy importante, y creo que nosotros, probablemente no me quita tanto el sueño porque es un pequeño porcentaje de nuestra población.', 'Así que no las incluí aquí.', 'Y, por supuesto, las cosas de las que se puede hablar son limitadas.', 'Pero si es tan importante que las pacientes se hayan hecho pruebas de BRCA en la línea germinal.', 'Y si las vas a hacer, si una paciente viene y no se ha hecho una prueba de BRCA en la línea germinal, puedes hacer la secuenciación de última generación, que es algo que ibas a hacer de todos modos para el cáncer y obtendrás la mutación.', 'Y entonces, puedes volver atrás y hacer pruebas de la línea germinal.', 'O sea, frotis de la mucosa o si la cuestión económica sigue siendo un problema, se las puede tratar como BRCA+ porque tenemos datos que sugieren que incluso para las mutaciones somáticas, vemos respuestas con inhibidores de la PARP.', 'Y luego, creo que otra cuestión que surge es qué pasa con una paciente con la mutación PALB2.', 'Vemos esto en la enfermedad triple negativa así como en la enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales.', 'Y en ese grupo de pacientes, ¿cómo decidiríamos sobre los inhibidores de la PARP?', 'Y hemos visto datos escasos pero muy alentadores de que estos cánceres también responden a la inhibición de la PARP.', 'Entonces, en mi opinión lo que creo es que si pudieras administrarlo, lo intentamos y lo administramos.', 'Se puede conseguir el uso compasivo a través de las empresas que fabrican inhibidores de la PARP si el medicamento no está aprobado en su país, en gran medida, no siempre, pero a veces, por ejemplo si una paciente tiene una mutación PALB2 o una mutación somática.', 'Y luego, la otra pregunta es ¿cuándo se debe administrar el inhibidor de la PARP con el otro tratamiento?', 'Y creo que en el caso de los inhibidores de CDK4/6, creemos que se les debe administrar primero antes que el inhibidor de la PARP porque hemos visto estos beneficios en la supervivencia.', 'O sea, es bien tolerado en la mayoría de las pacientes.', 'Y el inhibidor de la PARP sería la segunda línea.', 'Sin embargo, en la enfermedad triple negativa, simplemente no tenemos grandes opciones para las pacientes que son PD-L1–, que son la mayoría de nuestras pacientes.', 'Así que, si una paciente pudiera recibir un inhibidor de la PARP como primera línea, yo lo elegiría porque creo que depende del volumen de enfermedad que tenga y de si tiene crisis visceral.', 'Pero también, aunque de nuevo es una indicación no autorizada, usaría un inhibidor de la PARP como tratamiento de mantenimiento en pacientes que responden a la quimioterapia si tienes que empezar con quimioterapia.', 'Porque creo que cuanto antes le des el inhibidor de la PARP, más tiempo permanecerá la paciente y potencialmente esas pacientes pueden obtener un beneficio en la supervivencia en un análisis de subgrupos no planeado del ensayo OlympiA.', 'Entonces, creo que aquí el escenario se volverá más y más complejo porque tendremos inhibidores de la PARP adyuvantes, es como la CDK4/6.', 'Así que creo que será cada vez más complicado y vamos a probar cada vez más.', 'Y bueno, esta población de pacientes aumentará con el tiempo.', 'Por tanto creo que tenemos que estar preparados.', 'Además...', 'Solo tenemos una paciente que estaba en un ensayo y recibió un inhibidor de CDK4/6 en el estadio incipiente.', 'Y recibió palbo, así que se le podría haber administrado otro inhibidor de CDK4/6.', 'Ella no recayó durante el tratamiento.', 'Fue después de dejarlo.', 'Pero tiene una mutación BRCA2 y tenía en hueso y pleura.', 'Así que empecé a darle olaparib y todavía lo está recibiendo.', 'Lleva unos siete meses de tratamiento.', 'Por tanto, realmente es una gran opción que considerar.', 'Solo hay que individualizar.', 'Además, tendemos a dar carboplatino cada vez más a pacientes triple negativas.', 'Y si son BRCA+, no tenemos datos de los inhibidores de la PARP después de los compuestos con platino.', 'Así que creo que hay muchas cosas que se superponen y no podemos tener respuestas para ello y nunca las tendremos tampoco de los ensayos clínicos.', 'Y bien, creo que nos estamos quedando sin tiempo.', 'Creo que ha sido realmente muy útil.', 'Así que la próxima vez, volveremos a pedirle que participe en esta charla, Hope, porque creo que ha sido muy interesante y estimulante, y muchas gracias.', 'Muchas gracias, y gracias a todos ustedes que nos están escuchando y por sus interesantes preguntas.', 'Gracias.', 'Hasta pronto.', 'Adiós.']\n",

Katia Pérez, y un oncólogo radiactivo, la profesora María Antonieta Gambacorta.', 'so we start with professor with dr katia peris that will give a view of the medical oncologist in rectal cancer and after we will end up with professor gambacorta that will give a view of the radiation oncologist in rectal cancer treatment', 'and in the end we are open to questions and to discuss what you think is pertinent for this section', 'Katja, por favor, adelante.', 'Buenas tardes y es un placer estar aquí hoy.', 'Mi nombre es Katia Roque-Pérez y voy a presentar una revisión de la gestión multidisciplinaria en cáncer de recto.', 'Before 2020, there are two standard different standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer, a short course of radiotherapy or long course of chemoradiotherapy followed with TMA surgery and adjuvant chemotherapy for patients with risk factors.', 'Si bien este enfoque multimodal ha mejorado las tasas de recurrencia local, no ha tenido efectos significativos en las tasas de recurrencia distante o en la supervivencia general.', 'That is how important questions emerged about the benefits of each component of the multimodal approach.', 'El primero, ¿cuál es el régimen óptimo para la radioterapia de nodulación? ¿El corto curso o el largo curso?', 'En Polonia, se comparan los cursos preparativos de radioterapia, corto, seguido de cirugía, dentro de siete días, con los cursos de quimioterapia y radioterapia, largos, seguidos de cirugía, en cuatro a seis semanas.', 'The overall survival, disease-free survival and local recurrence at four years were similar between the two groups.', 'Sin embargo, los pacientes que recibieron el curso largo tuvieron una mayor respuesta completa con 16% frente a 0,7%.', 'also the transcisplatin-radiation oncology group compared preoperative short course of radiotherapy a long course of chemoradiotherapy in patients with t three tumors', 'No significant difference in oncology outcomes were reported, but patients with short course of radiotherapy had a higher rate of local recurrence with 7% versus 4% and lower rate of pathology complete response with 1% versus 15%.', 'En este punto, tenemos una pregunta más.', 'What is the prognosis by the light of pathology complete response?', 'and meta-analysis identified twenty seven articles based on seventeen different datasets for long-term outcomes of patients with and without pathologic complete response', 'primary outcome was five year disease free survival and it was eighty three percent for patients with pathologic complete response versus sixty five percent for patients without pathologic complete response', 'Además, tienen mejores resultados a largo plazo, como recurrencia local, regional, recurrencia distante y supervivencia general.', 'It might be indicative of pathology complete response is a prognostically favorable factor in local advanced rectal cancer.', 'Pero, ¿qué pasa si retrasamos la cirugía?', 'Optimal dosing and time to surgery were investigated in the Stockholm 3 non-inferiority trial.', 'Eight hundred and forty patients with resectable rectal cancer were divided in three groups.', 'Corto curso de quimioterapia con cirugía inmediata, corto curso de quimioterapia con cirugía de 4 a 6 semanas de retraso y largo curso de quimioterapia.', \"The disease outcome didn't differ between the three groups, but patients with underwent with short course of radiotherapy with delayed surgery had a lower rate of postoperative complications, greater tumor regression and a higher rate of pathology complete percent, with 11% versus 1% than patients with immediate surgery.\", 'Therefore, short course of radiotherapy with delayed surgery is a viable alternative to long course of chemoradiotherapy.', 'Pero, ¿qué pasó con la quimioterapia?', 'The POLISH trial evaluated short course of radiotherapy and consolidation of chemotherapy versus chemoradiation with fluorouracil and oxaliplatin in rectal cancers with clinical T4 or 3.', 'With a median follow-up of seven years, there was no difference in local and distant recurrence, disease-free survival and overall survival.', 'But the group of short course has less acute toxicity with similar pathology complete response and but and proficient surgery.', 'Con el beneficio de la quimioterapia en un estudio de doble ciego, ¿necesitan radiación todos los pacientes?', 'The Phase II prospect trial is currently investigating selective radiotherapy in patients with intermediate risk who are eligible for a sphincter-preserving treatment.', 'En el brazo seleccionado, los pacientes recibieron seis ciclos de nadcabox, seguido de una evaluación de respuesta con proctoscopia y resonancia magnética.', 'Those with more than 20% then surgery, patients with less than 20% receive chemoradiotherapy, surgery.', 'The data is awaiting moderation, but it is a promising start.', 'En este punto, el concepto de terapia de red total llega.', 'Naltuvant chemotherapy can be given either before chemoradiotherapy as induction treatment or after as consolidation, but both prior to surgical resection.', 'These studies evaluate the effectiveness of chemotherapy in different times.', 'The Spanish 3, a phase II trial which compared induction chemotherapy versus long course of chemo radiotherapy.

With long-course of chemo- radiotherapy, followed by surgery in four to six weeks.', 'The overall survival, disease-free survival, and local recurrence at four years were similar between the two groups.', 'However, patients who received the long- course had higher pathologic complete response, with 16% versus 0.7%.', 'Also, the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group compared preoperatively short-course of radiotherapy and long-course of chemo- radiotherapy in patients with T3 tumours.', 'No significant difference in oncology outcomes were reported, but patients with short-course of radiotherapy had a higher rate of local recurrence with 7% versus 4%, and lower rate of pathologic complete response, with 1% versus 15%.', 'At this point, we have one more question.', 'What is the prognosis by lieu of pathologic complete response?', 'A meta-analysis identified 27 articles based on 17 different data sets for long-term outcomes of patients with and without pathologic complete response.', 'Primary outcome was five-year disease-free survival, and it was 83% for patients with pathologic complete response versus 65% for patients without pathologic complete response.', 'Also, they have better long-term outcome, like locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, and overall survival.', 'It might be indicative of pathologic complete response a prognosis of favourable factor in local advanced rectal cancer.', 'But what happens if we delay surgery?', 'Optimal dosing and time to surgery were investigated in the Stockholm III non- inferiority trial.', '840 patients with resectable rectal cancer were divided in three groups.', 'Short-course of chemo-radiotherapy with immediate surgery, short-course of chemo-radiotherapy with surgery four to six weeks later, and long-course of chemo-radiotherapy.', \"This outcome didn't interfere between the two groups, but patients who underwent short-course of radiotherapy with delayed surgery, had a lower rate of post- operative complications, greater tumour regression, and a higher rate of pathologic complete percent, with 11% versus 1%, than patients with immediate surgery.\", 'Therefore, short-course of radiotherapy with delayed surgery is a viable alternative to long-course of chemo-radiotherapy.', 'But what happened about chemotherapy?', 'The Polish trial evaluated short-course of radiotherapy and consolidation of chemotherapy versus chemo-radiation with fluorouracil and oxaliplatin in rectal cancers with clinical T4 or 3.', 'With a median follow-up of seven years, there was no difference in local and distant recurrence, disease-free-survival and overall survival.', 'But, the group of short-course has less acute toxicity with similar pathologic complete response and proficient surgery.', 'With a benefit of chemotherapy in adjuvant setting, do all patients need radiation?', 'The phase II PROSPECT trial is currently investigating selective radiotherapy in patients with intermediate-risk who are eligible for a sphincter-preserving treatment.', 'In the selective arm, patients received six cycles of neoadjuvant FOLFOX, followed with the responsible regimen with proctoscopy and magnetic resonance.', 'Those with more than 20%, then surgery, patients with less than 20% received chemo- radiotherapy concurrent, and surgery.', 'The data is awaiting validation, but is a promising study.', 'Okay, at this point, the concept of total neoadjuvant therapy arrived.', 'Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be given either before chemo-radiotherapy as induction treatment, or after as consolidation, but both prior to surgical resection.', 'These studies have outlined the effectiveness of chemotherapy in different time.', 'The Spanish III, a phase II trial, which compared induction chemotherapy versus long-course of chemo-radiotherapy, the results showed no significant difference in disease outcomes, but a lower toxicity and improved compliance of treatment with induction are compared with the adjuvant chemotherapy were reported.', 'On the other hand, the use of consolidation chemotherapy was explored in this multi-centre trial conducted by Garcia- Aguilar.', 'There were four arms.', 'The group one had total mesorectal excision six to eight weeks after chemo- radiation.', 'Groups two to four received two, four or six cycles of FOLFOX respectively between chemo- radiation, and total mesorectal excision.', 'They demonstrated good tolerance and significantly higher pathologic complete response in patients who received chemotherapy, with 38% for patients who received six cycles of FOLFOX.', 'No difference in a sphincter saving surgery, R0 resection, technical difficulty, and grade 3-4 operative complications were reported.', 'So, what is the optimal sequence of chemotherapy before or after concurrence?', 'In the CAO/ ARO phase II trial, patients with a stage 2 or 3 were assigned to group A for induction chemotherapy, or to group B for consolidation chemotherapy after concurrence with FOLFOX.', 'Primary endpoint was pathologic complete response.', 'In the intention-to-treat population, pathologic complete response was achieved in 17% in group A, and in 25% in group B, which is significantly higher for group B. Also, less grade 3-4 toxicities and better compliance during concurrence were reported for this group.', 'However, we have to emphasise that the time delay for surgery in group B was the double than in group A. In ESCO 2020, Rapido phase III trial was presented.', '920 patients with high-risk of rectal cancer where randomized to either short-course of radiotherapy followed with vast systemic consolidation with six cycles of CAPOX, or nine cycles of FOLFOX and TME surgery versus traditional long-concurrence, followed with the TME surgery.', 'The primary endpoint was three-year disease-related treatment failure, defined as first occurrence of locoregional failure, distant metastases, new primary colorectal tumour, or treatment-related death.', 'Disease-related death failure was 23% in the experimental group, versus 30% in the control-arm with a significant difference.', 'Also, patients in the TNT arm achieve a higher pathologic complete response with 28% versus 14% and a lower three-year rate of distant recurrence with 20% versus 27%.', 'The Prodige-23 phase III multi-centred trial, randomized 461 patients into arms, to either six cycles of FOLFIRINOX followed by chemo-radiation, surgery, and three months of adjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant chemo-radiation followed by surgery and six months of adjuvant chemotherapy.', 'Primary endpoint was three-year disease- free survival.', 'Patients in the TNT arm had a higher rate of pathologic complete response with 28% versus 12%, higher rate of disease-free survival at three years with 76% versus 69%, unless distant recurrence, with 21% versus 28%.', 'No difference in local recurrence or overall survival were reported.', 'In conclusion, the ability to reduce the risk of systemic recurrence, the increased rates of pathologic and clinical complete response with TNT have opened opportunities in selected patients.', 'Finally, based in patients with pathologic complete response have excellent oncologic outcomes.', 'Can surgery be avoided in patients with no clinical evidence of disease following adjuvant therapy?', \"The Watch-and-Wait has been studied most extensively by Dr Habr- Gama's group in Sao Paulo.\", 'They reported that patients with resectable distal rectal cancer were offered a strict surveillance if they had complete clinical response based on magnetic resonance and endoscopy one- year after completion of chemo-radiotherapy.', 'Complete clinical response was found in 27% of patients, and those patients were able to avoid TME.', 'Locoregional recurrence was found in 25% of those patients, all of one underwent successful salvaged surgery.', 'Other studies demonstrate high-rates of rectum preservation and successful salvage of local recurrence, but they were admitted by a small sample size, the heterogeneity of the study populations, and relatively short follow-up.', 'Herein, we show a retrospective analysis of an international database of about 1000 rectal cancer patients managed with Watch-and-Wait approach.', 'With similar report, 25% of patients had a local regrowth after a median follow-up of three-years, and only 8% of patients presented distant recurrence.', 'What is more, 88% of recurrences were diagnosed within the first two years.', 'And 97% was located in the bowel wall.', 'Accordingly, surgical resection may be avoided in some patients.', 'The final message, multidisciplinary management is essential.', 'Pathologic complete response is now a prognostic factor.', 'Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is now validated in local advanced rectal cancer.', 'TNT approach offers an improvement in the rate of pathologic complete response, and treatment has been selected accordingly with risk factors of the patients.', \"That's all.\", 'Thank you.', 'Thank you very much, Katia.', \"It was a very nice overview of the Medical Oncologist's role in rectal cancer.\", 'Dr Zahel Lakkis, our surgeon that is also participating in this section here, will have the opportunity to comment in the end.', 'I would like to ask now Professor Gambacorta from Rome, Italy, a city which I like very much, and I have been there 10 times, so, to talk about the Radiation Oncologist overview.', 'Okay.', 'Thank you very much, Dr Bezerra, and thank you very much, Katia Roque Perez, for this very nice presentation.', \"So, I'm just going to point out some aspects of the radiotherapy treatment.\", \"So, we know right now that the standard treatment to cure rectal cancer, they're presented by the TME surgery, okay.\", 'And radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be delivered before or after surgery, trying to improve oncological outcomes and to improve also quality of life.', 'As Dr Perez showed us, we have two main ways to deliver radiotherapy, which is the short-course followed by immediate surgery, with surgery delivered in the week after the end of radiotherapy, which lasts five days And it is finished in one week, and long-course chemo-radiation, where you use smaller daily dose of radiotherapy delivered in five weeks to a dose between 45 and 50, together with concomitant chemotherapy, and then you have to wait between six to eight weeks before delivering surgery.', 'So, this was the topic of the so-called the first-generation study.', 'This first- generation study was started with short-course, it was compared with surgery alone, and where long-course pre-operative chemo-radiation was compared with post-operative chemo-radiation, or pre-operative radiotherapy.', 'The aim was to see if there was an increase on long-term outcomes, and the trial that radiotherapy or chemo-radiation compared to radiotherapy alone, increased the rate of local control.', 'However, they did not increase the disease-free survival or overall survival, except in two trials.', 'The first one is the Swedish trial, which was a trial in which surgery was delivered without total mesorectal excision.', 'So, it was before the introduction of total mesorectal excision, and the second is the Dutch trial, which is a trial which was conducted in patients with unresectable tumours.', 'So, the first take home-message is that pre- operative radiotherapy or pre-operative chemo-radiation delivered together with surgery, which is the corrective treatment in rectal cancer, increase the local control.', 'The other thing I wanted to say, going back to the previous slide is that with the short-course radiotherapy followed by immediate surgery, you can obtain an increased local control, whereas we deliver pre-operative chemo-radiation followed by delayed surgery for two reasons.', 'The first one is because you intensify, and the second one is because you wait for the down-staging of the tumour, you also can achieve a down-staging.', 'And down-staging, it is important for two reasons.', 'First of all, is to improve the outcomes of the patients, in fact, you know, that a tumour in the mesorectal fascia or when you have positive resection margins after surgery, these may decrease long-term outcomes in terms of local recurrence, metastases, and overall survival.', 'So, you know that when you deliver pre-operative chemo-radiation, we delay surgery.', 'You obtain down-staging [and downsizing of] the tumour which moves from the mesorectal fascia.', 'So, in that case, we can obtain more resection with negative circumferential resection margin.', 'And this may improve the local control, may decrease the distant metastases, and may improve the overall survival.', 'And this was demonstrated in the Swedish trial.', 'This is a focus on the Swedish trial, which was a trial in where there was an increase of local control, distant metastases, and cancer specific survival for those patients who received chemo-radiation therapy, [compared to those who received preoperative radiotherapy alone], who obtained a higher rate of R0 resection.', 'So, pre-operative chemo-radiation by providing down-staging of the tumour, give the possibility to have a higher R0 resection and long-term outcomes.', 'Not only local control, but also distant metastases.', 'On the other hand, if we think to this first-generation trial, you know that a tumour can shrink also in the length.', 'So, in the tumour length, and in the case the tumour moves away from the anorectal junction, the patients can receive a surgery with the preservation of their sphincter.', 'However, in randomised trials, [no advantage was demonstrated] in sphincter preservation in those patients who received pre-operative chemo-radiation.', 'But… if you have any question, please chat on the chat box.', 'But what happened with these studies? that we faced the pathological complete response.', 'So, we have seen that in a, which is around 20% in local advanced rectal cancer and may achieve 40% in earlier cancers.', 'So, early T3 tumours or T2 tumours, patients who achieve a pathological complete response and as Katia already showed in her presentation, patients who had a pathologic complete response to pre-operative chemo-radiation have also better long- term outcomes in terms of local control, distant metastases, disease-free, and overall survival.', 'So, the second-generation studies on pre-operative treatments, especially those studies with long-course chemo- radiation concentrated to intensified treatment.', 'How?', 'By the addition of oxaliplatin.', 'So, in 2000, we faced studies in which oxaliplatin was added to 5FU in pre-operative chemo-radiation with the aim to improve pCR, and also to improve DFS, disease-free survival.', 'As you can see, they failed to demonstrate the effect of oxaliplatin, except [two trials], the Chinese and especially the German trial, which has an increase of pCR, and also increase of DFS.', 'And they explained these results, either by less acute toxicity and better compliance of the patients.', 'So, they reduced the number of doses of oxaliplatin, and also, they reduced the dose of oxaliplatin delivered.', 'And by this method, they had less acute toxicity and better compliance of patients, and this resulted in better short-term and long-term outcomes.', 'This increase of pCR, since pCR means better long-term outcomes, led to put in place trials and nowadays, since 2015 up to now, we are facing a lot of trials which are trying to avoid surgery.', 'So, trials and organ preservation that can be done with a Watch-and- wait approach, or with a local excision.', 'And already, as Dr Perez showed, for example, for the Watch-and- Wait approach, we have very good results because, we know that of 20% of patients with complete response, 25% have a re-growth, but this re-growth is salvageable, and this salvage surgery leads to a very high-rate of overall survival and disease-free survival.', 'It has also been seen that patients with complete response have a very low rate of distance metastases, even though you have to be careful because patients with local regrowth may have a higher-risk of distant metastases compared to those patients who maintain a clinical complete response over time.', 'So, the idea is now how to increase the rate of patients with clinical complete response with complete response?', 'Is the chemotherapy intensification.', 'And as Dr Perez showed us, we are moving to the total neoadjuvant therapy, where we have seen that it seems to be better, the consolidation chemotherapy, so, chemotherapy after radiotherapy, than neoadjuvant chemotherapy.', 'So, it is better to consolidate instead of using chemotherapy before radiotherapy or chemo-radiation.', \"The second way to improve is the dose escalation, which was mentioned again by Dr Perez, was to increase the time between the end of radiotherapy and surgery and we're facing several trials also of chemo-radiation also moving from local advanced rectal cancer to early tumours.\", 'So, I will skip the chemotherapy intensification because Dr Perez already showed us a lot of results and we will move to the dose escalation in radiotherapy.', 'As a radiation oncologist, we know that the higher is the dose, the higher is the tumour response on one hand, and the higher and bigger is the volume of tumour, the higher is the dose that you have to deliver.', 'So, but which is the dose that we should deliver?', \"It's been seen that to obtain a complete response in 50% of patients you have to deliver really high doses up to 90 Gy.\", 'You have to think that nowadays the dose that we deliver in pre-operative radiotherapy of chemo-radiation, the standard is between 45 to 50 Gy.', \"In even more cases, we can arrive up to 55 Gy and now there are some trials arriving up to 60 Gy. it's more than 60 Gy.\", 'You can have a higher rate of pathological complete response with the same rate of acute toxicity.', 'And how we can improve the dose?', 'In two ways.', 'One way is called intensity modulated radiotherapy, I will show you later how it works, by which we can direct different doses to the targets according to the tumour burden, [So that] we can treat the volume where we think there are microscopic tumour cells with lower dose and at the same time we can deliver higher dose on what we call the GTV, the gross tumour volume, the macroscopic tumour, but we also achieve even higher doses by using local therapies, one of these is brachytherapy.', 'So, it is a radiotherapy technique where you put the source, the radiation source, with an applicator directly in contact with the tumour.', 'The contact therapy, which is a surface, a sort of surface radiotherapy, where you deliver very high doses of low energy x-rays, and you can remove the tumour layer by layer.', 'And with this technique, you have very few acute toxicities because you just irradiate the tumour, avoiding completely the normal tissues.', 'On the other hand, there is the time.', 'This is a meta-analysis that we have done on, I think, seven randomised trials run in Europe to measure the rate of pathological complete response.', 'According to time, we have seen that 95% of pCR appears after 10 weeks, and after the 16th week we have a plateau.', 'So, if you want to wait for a higher number of pCR you have to wait more than 10 weeks, this is the message after pre-operative chemo-radiation.', 'Then, I want to finish with the advances in radiotherapy.', \"So, I don't know if you, in the audience, I don't think that you are all Radiation Oncologists, but you know that when nowadays, Radiation Oncologists, when we talk about radiotherapy delivery, we talk about the intensity modulated radiotherapy, or volumetric modulated radiotherapy, which is a way to modulate, to decrease the dose to the organ at risk and to modulate the dose inside the different volumes that we irradiate.\", 'The second advance that we had was the on-board imaging.', 'You know, that we as Radiation Oncologists, we work with imaging because we have to point our rays on the target, so we have to work with images.', \"And nowadays, we have the possibility to see the tumour, we don't use imaging only for the planning, but we use the imaging also during the treatment.\", 'And I will show you, which are the on-board imaging that nowadays we have available on our machines to see the tumour while we irradiate it.', 'And the third one is, and this may help you, to adapt radiotherapy.', 'That means that we do not decide the radiation dose at the beginning of the treatment, but that we can modulate the dose according to the tumour response during the treatment, and I will use three examples.', 'The first one, this is what we call intensity modulated radiotherapy.', 'In the 3D radiotherapy the target volume is included is all included in the field, however part of the organs at risk, they are included in the high-dose of radiotherapy.', 'While in intensity modulation of radiotherapy dose, we can spare the organs at risk, especially those which are located inside the target volume.', 'We can modulate the dose on the tumours, giving less dose where we want to eradicate microscopic tumour cells and higher dosing where the tumour is present.', 'Okay?', 'The second thing is this one.', 'This is the image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Nowadays, we have available in our department this machine which are more and more spread around the world, which is a hybrid machine in which we have a linear accelerator together with an MRI.', 'It is called MRI-LINAC. By this, we can see the tumour during each [fraction] how it moves.', 'The blue line is if the tumour goes out of the blue one, the machine stops delivering the dose.', 'This means that you can spare the organ at risk and you can decrease the margin around the tumour.', 'Today, the patient can see where the tumour is.', 'So, especially not in the case of rectal cancer, but especially for those tumours, which are located in the liver or in the lung, they can control their breath to let the tumour stay inside the blue line.', 'And we also can see what happens through the treatment.', 'So, you can see, this is the tumour at the first week of treatment, second, third, fourth, fifth, and at the end of the treatment.', 'You can see that the tumour shrinks during the treatment.', 'Moreover, you know that nowadays we have radiomics.', \"Radiomics is a way to read quantitatively, I don't know how to say it, the MRI images.\", 'So, for example, in this case, looking at the shrinkage of the tumour and measuring radiomics at certain time, what we can do is that we can adapt the dose according to the prevision of the tumour response.', 'And this is a trial, it is a mono-centric trial phase II that we are running in our institution with this MRI_ LINAC, patients with rectal cancer, with intermediate- stage of rectal cancer.', 'So, T2, T2 N1, or T3 N0 N1, or T4 N0. [These patients] are treated with pre-operative chemo-radiation.', 'Then, at the second week, we go to measure volume and we do radiomics on the image, and we do the Delta radiomics between the start and the treatment at two weeks.', 'So, if we see that the tumour responds, we have a high chance of complete response.', 'If this is the case, the patient can continue with the dose they started at the beginning.', 'If we can, if our prevision is that the tumour will not achieve a complete response, we deliver a boost during the treatment, we arrive up to 60 Gy.', 'That means that we modulate the dose, according to the tumour response.', \"So, we adapt the treatment to the tumour's behaviour right during the treatment.\", \"So, that's just to say that my take-home message on the role of radiotherapy is that we know that radiotherapy nowadays increases local control, and as Katia showed, the complete response after chemo-radiation is related to better outcomes.\", 'And in those patients, we are trying to avoid surgery to improve quality of life.', 'And the way to increase the complete response is done by intensification, so TNT, or radiotherapy dose, or we may also increase the lag, the time between the end of pre-operative treatment and that from the Radiation Oncologists point of view, and that from the Radiation Oncologists point of view, I wanted to show you new technologies that may help us to according to tumour response.', 'So, thank you very much for your attention.', 'Thank you very much, Maria.', 'It was a very, very nice presentation.', \"I think we have a very good overview of how we can deal with rectal cancer's patients in a multi-disciplinary way.\", 'I would like to give the word to Professor Zahel Lakkis to understand a little bit his perception as a surgeon, how we can place chemo- radiation therapy before, after.', 'I would like to hear a little bit about your opinion regarding TNT strategies to treat patients.', 'So, please, give us your thoughts.', 'Thank you, Ramon.', 'First, I would like to congratulate both presentations because it was very, very good quality of slides.', 'And I learned a lot about new technologies in radiotherapy, so, thank you very much.', 'Before questions, maybe, I have just a comment.', 'Here in France, we have adopted the Prodige-23 trial.', 'In fact, very few centres use the Rapido protocol there are a lot of reasons, but as a surgeon, when now I have to explain to a patient that he will have to have three months of chemotherapy, then one month, five weeks of radiotherapy, then wait two months, then surgery, then he has to recover from surgery, then three months of chemotherapy, then, you have to close the stoma.', \"So, for more and more young patients especially, who have to support a TNT, we are talking about a one-year protocol in fact, and it's not a question, it's just a remark that in some cases it could be very difficult for the patients to stop any work, any social life almost.\", 'So, it was just my comment, but the results are very, very good.', 'In fact, we are improving the survival of the patient and now we have, and this is my really concern, my main concern, we have now almost 30% of complete response when we do a TME.', 'So, my question would be maybe for both, how could we now maybe avoid 30% of unnecessary TME in patients with T3 N0 or T2 N1 patients, should we still perform a TME for all patients with a suspicion of clinical complete response after TNT protocols?', 'What is your opinion about that?', \"Because I think that as a surgeon, I'm doing 30% of almost unnecessary surgeries.\", 'Maria and Katia, do you want to talk?', 'Go Katia, go Katia.', 'Okay.', 'In ESCO 2020, they presented the preliminary results of the trial, which is a phase III, evaluating a stage 2 or 3 rectal cancer, who received a total neoadjuvant and FOLFOX or CAPOX as induction or consolidation therapy, followed by watch-and-wait approach with one-year of follow-up.', 'We have now results, preliminary results, at two-years of follow-up, which show 58% of patients in the consolidation arm have a sphincter preservation.', 'And there are promising results, and we are waiting for more data.', 'But I think that watch-and-wait is a good alternative for patients with distal rectal cancer and very young patients, which quality of life is a priority to develop.', 'Maria, what do you think?', 'I agree, because there is 30% of patients who achieve a complete response, but on the other hand, there are 70% of patients who do not.', 'So, these patients receive very long, long treatment and then at the end, they finish to have a TME, so, we have to consider both.', 'What is, in my opinion, is that we have to pursue we have to, in case the question of Dr Lakkis was, in these patients with complete response, do we have to avoid TME?', 'I think, yes.', \"However, I think that we should, nowadays, we don't have a real tool to preview which will be the patients who will respond.\", 'So, this is the way we have to go I think, in the future.', 'So, prediction model, trying to predict who will respond and who will not, because in this case, we can select those patients who will respond and select those patients who will never respond.', 'And in this case, they could directly go to a TME with better functional outcome compared to those patients who receive pre- operative treatment plus TME, together with a long time of treatment.', 'You know?', 'So, I think that the way to go is, to go for a prediction model to try to better select those patients who may be treated with radiotherapy alone, radiotherapy or chemo-radiation, on radiotherapy and chemotherapy to avoid surgery, and those patients in which avoiding all these treatments and go directly to TME because in some T3 N0 patients, TME is enough and they will have also good results, especially those in the mid rectum, or in the high rectum.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'I totally agree with you.', 'I think we can be less harmful for the patients and possibly try to predict what kind of response they will have; it will help to get these better decisions in the future.', \"And maybe, if I can ask you one additional question, I don't know, in your experience, but in mine, we have more and more younger patients than 5, 10 or 15 years ago.\", \"And in my experience, I meet patients with tumours, with mucinous differentiation, and I have the feeling that those tumours don't have the same response with FOLFOX or FOLFIRINOX and even with chemo-radiotherapy, and these patients are the younger, we intensify the treatments, but those tumours are really in bad response.\", 'And do you think that we have to more and more intensify the treatments with increasing the dose of radiation?', 'Because those tumours for me, in my practice, are really, really problematic.', 'And I think that we are going to have more and more patients with these kinds of tumours.', \"I don't know why, maybe this is some behaviour changes in our diet, or what, but I think it's really, because those patients were not involved and enrolled in previous trials.\", '15, 20 years ago, those tumours were very rare.', 'And now, I have a feeling that we are confronting to more and more mucinous tumours.', 'To which kind of tumour are you referring?', 'Tumours with the colorectal differentiation mucinous.', 'Ah, the mucinous.', 'These mucinous tumours are very hard to treat.', 'Yes.', \"And they usually develop metastases very early and also in unpredictable places, I saw metastases in the skin, in the kidney, and I really don't know because usually those tumours with a lot of mucins, they do not, sometimes, they do not respond.\", \"Other times, they, you find they apparently do not respond, and then on the pathological specimen, you just see mucin and you don't see any tumour cells, but I agree completely with you, which is very difficult.\", 'It might be that these patients, since they develop metastases earlier, or in unpredicted places, they could be, it could be given a priority to chemotherapy.', \"I don't know.\", \"I don't know if Katia has an idea on how to treat these tumours.\", \"It's a very complicated to treat tumour.\", \"We don't have many cases, but the cases that we have usually with very bulky disease and advanced disease.\", \"Actually, mucinous is very, it's not so chemo-sensitive, and it brings us challenges to this type of approach.\", 'And so.', \"No, usually these tumours are, correct me if I'm wrong, Katia, these tumours have usually the mutation of BRAF, are BRAF mutated, from what is my experience.\", \"So, I don't know if in the future we will develop a molecule that goes against this tumour.\", 'I think that there are some Medical Oncologists, there are some studies in this way trying to select these patients by the mutational point of view.', 'Yes, I think.', 'All right.', 'I think our time end-up, I would like to congrats everyone that participated here in this multi-disciplinary section for rectal cancer, I think it was exciting to discuss with you several aspects of this disease.', 'That is very hard to treat as we saw here.', \"I'd like to congrats all the speakers, all the panel, here, Dr Perez, Prof Gambacorta, and Prof Lakkis for their participation here.\", 'And I wish you a very nice rest of day or night, depending on the part of the globe you are.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you.', 'Bye-bye.', 'Thank you.', 'Bye.']\n",

Buenas tardes, es un placer estar aquí hoy.', 'Y mi nombre es Katia Roque Pérez, y voy a presentar una revisión del manejo multidisciplinario del cáncer rectal.', 'Antes de 2020, existen dos tratamientos estándar diferentes para el cáncer rectal localmente avanzado, un ciclo corto de radioterapia o un ciclo largo de radioquimioterapia, seguidos de cirugía con EMT y quimioterapia adyuvante para pacientes con factores de riesgo.', 'Si bien este enfoque multimodal ha mejorado las tasas de recurrencia local, no ha tenido efectos significativos en las tasas de recurrencia a distancia o la supervivencia global.', 'Así es como surgen preguntas importantes acerca de los beneficios de cada componente del enfoque multimodal.', 'La primera, ¿cuál es el régimen óptimo para la radioterapia neoadyuvante, el ciclo corto o el ciclo largo?', 'En Polonia, Bujkio y colaboradores compararon el ciclo corto preoperatorio de radioterapia, seguido de cirugía en los siete días siguientes con un ciclo largo de radioquimioterapia, seguido de cirugía en cuatro a seis semanas.', 'La supervivencia global, la supervivencia sin enfermedad y la recurrencia local a los cuatro años fueron similares entre los dos grupos.', 'Sin embargo, los pacientes que recibieron el tratamiento de larga duración presentaron una respuesta patológica completa superior, del 16% frente al 0,7%.', 'Además, el Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group comparó la radioterapia preoperatoria de corta duración y la radioquimioterapia de larga duración en pacientes con tumores T3.', 'No se notificaron diferencias significativas en los resultados oncológicos, pero los pacientes con un ciclo corto de radioterapia presentaron una tasa mayor de recidiva local, con un 7% frente al 4%, y una tasa menor de respuesta patológica completa, con un 1% frente al 15%.', 'En este punto, surge una pregunta más.', '¿Cuál es el pronóstico en lugar de la respuesta patológica completa?', 'En un metanálisis se identificaron 27 artículos basados en 17 conjuntos de datos diferentes de resultados a largo plazo en pacientes con y sin respuesta patológica completa.', 'El criterio principal de valoración fue la supervivencia sin enfermedad a los cinco años, y fue del 83% para los pacientes con respuesta patológica completa frente al 65% para los pacientes sin respuesta patológica completa.', 'Además, tienen mejores resultados a largo plazo, como la recurrencia locorregional, la recurrencia a distancia, y la supervivencia global.', 'Podría ser indicativo de que la respuesta patológica completa es un pronóstico de factor favorable en el cáncer rectal localizado avanzado.', '¿Pero qué pasa si retrasamos la cirugía?', 'En el ensayo de ausencia de inferioridad Stockholm III se investigó la posología óptima y el tiempo hasta la cirugía.', '840 pacientes con cáncer rectal resecable se dividieron en tres grupos.', 'Ciclo corto de radioquimioterapia con cirugía inmediata, ciclo corto de radioquimioterapia con cirugía de cuatro a seis semanas después y ciclo largo de radioquimioterapia.', 'Este resultado no interfirió entre los dos grupos, sin embargo, los pacientes sometidos a un ciclo corto de radioterapia con cirugía diferida, tuvieron una tasa menor de complicaciones posoperatorias, mayor regresión tumoral y una tasa mayor de porcentaje completo patológico, con un 11% frente a un 1%, que los pacientes con cirugía inmediata.', 'Por lo tanto, un ciclo corto de radioterapia con cirugía diferida es una alternativa viable al ciclo largo de radioquimioterapia.', '¿Pero qué pasó con la quimioterapia?', 'El ensayo polaco evaluó el ciclo corto de radioterapia y la consolidación de la quimioterapia frente a la quimiorradiación con fluorouracilo y oxaliplatino en cánceres rectales con T4 o 3 clínicos.', 'Con una mediana de seguimiento de siete años, no hubo diferencias en cuanto a recurrencia local y a distancia, supervivencia sin enfermedad y supervivencia global.', 'Pero, el grupo de ciclo corto tiene menos toxicidad aguda con respuesta patológica completa similar y cirugía competente.', 'Con el beneficio de la quimioterapia como tratamiento adyuvante, ¿necesitan todos los pacientes radioterapia?', 'El ensayo de fase II PROSPECT está investigando actualmente la radioterapia selectiva en pacientes de riesgo intermedio que son candidatos a un tratamiento que preserva el esfínter.', 'En este grupo selectivo, los pacientes recibieron seis ciclos de FOLFOX como tratamiento neoadyuvante, seguido del régimen responsable con proctoscopia y resonancia magnética.', 'Aquellos con más del 20%, después cirugía, los pacientes con menos del 20% recibieron radioquimioterapia concomitante y cirugía.', 'Los datos están pendientes de validación, pero se trata de un estudio prometedor.', 'Bien, en este punto, llegó el concepto de tratamiento neoadyuvante total.', 'La quimioterapia neoadyuvante puede administrarse antes de la radioquimioterapia como tratamiento de inducción, o después como consolidación, pero ambos antes de la resección quirúrgica.', 'Estos estudios han descrito la eficacia de la quimioterapia en diferentes momentos.', 'En el estudio Spanish III, un ensayo de fase II, en el que se comparó la quimioterapia de inducción con el ciclo largo de radioquimioterapia, los resultados no revelaron diferencias significativas en los desenlaces de la enfermedad, pero se notificó una menor toxicidad y un mejor cumplimiento del tratamiento de inducción en comparación con la quimioterapia adyuvante.', 'Por otro lado, el uso de quimioterapia de consolidación se estudió en este ensayo multicéntrico realizado por García-Aguilar.', 'Había cuatro grupos.', 'El grupo uno se sometió a una escisión mesorrectal total entre seis y ocho semanas después de la quimiorradiación.', 'Los grupos dos a cuatro recibieron dos, cuatro o seis ciclos de FOLFOX respectivamente entre la quimiorradiación y la escisión mesorrectal total.', 'Demostraron buena tolerancia y una respuesta patológica completa significativamente superior en pacientes que recibieron quimioterapia, con un 38% en los pacientes que recibieron seis ciclos de FOLFOX.', 'No se notificaron diferencias en una cirugía con preservación del esfínter, resección R0, dificultad técnica y complicaciones operatorias grado 3-4.', 'Entonces, ¿cuál es la secuencia óptima de la quimioterapia antes o después de la administración conjunta?', 'En el ensayo de fase II CAO/ARO, los pacientes con estadio 2 o 3 fueron asignados al grupo A para recibir quimioterapia de inducción, o al grupo B para recibir quimioterapia de consolidación tras la administración conjunta con FOLFOX.', 'El criterio principal de valoración fue la respuesta patológica completa.', 'En la población por intención de tratar, se logró una respuesta patológica completa en el 17% de los pacientes del grupo A y en el 25% de los del grupo B, cifra significativamente mayor en el grupo B. Además, en este grupo se notificaron menos toxicidades de grado 3-4 y un mejor cumplimiento durante la administración simultánea.', 'Sin embargo, hay que destacar que el retraso en la cirugía del grupo B fue el doble que en el grupo A. En ESCO 2020 se presentó el ensayo Rápido de fase III.', 'Se aleatorizaron 920 pacientes con riesgo alto de cáncer rectal a un ciclo corto de radioterapia seguido de una vasta consolidación sistémica con seis ciclos de CAPOX, o nueve ciclos de FOLFOX y cirugía EMT frente a tratamiento conjunto tradicional de larga duración, seguido de cirugía EMT.', 'El criterio principal de valoración fue el fracaso terapéutico relacionado con la enfermedad a los tres años, definido como la primera aparición de fracaso locorregional, metástasis a distancia, nuevo tumor colorrectal primario o muerte relacionada con el tratamiento.', 'La muerte relacionada con la enfermedad fue del 23% en el grupo experimental, frente al 30% en el grupo de control, con una diferencia significativa.', 'Además, los pacientes del grupo de TNT alcanzan una respuesta patológica completa mayor con el 28% frente al 14% y una tasa menor de recidiva a distancia a los tres años con el 20% frente al 27%.', 'En el ensayo multicéntrico de fase III Prodige-23, se aleatorizaron 461 pacientes en dos grupos, a seis ciclos de FOLFIRINOX seguido de radioquimioterapia, cirugía y tres meses de quimioterapia adyuvante o radioquimioterapia adyuvante seguida de cirugía y seis meses de quimioterapia adyuvante.', 'El criterio principal de valoración fue la supervivencia sin enfermedad a los tres años.', 'Los pacientes del grupo de TNT tuvieron una tasa más alta de respuesta patológica completa con un 28% frente a un 12%, una tasa más alta de supervivencia sin enfermedad a los tres años con un 76% frente a un 69%, a menos que haya una recidiva a distancia, con un 21% frente a un 28%.', 'No se notificaron diferencias en la recurrencia local ni en la supervivencia global.', 'En conclusión, la capacidad de reducir el riesgo de recidiva sistémica, el aumento de las tasas de respuesta patológica y clínica completa con TNT han abierto oportunidades en determinados pacientes.', 'Finalmente, tomando como base los pacientes con respuesta patológica completa se tienen excelentes resultados oncológicos.', '¿Se puede evitar la cirugía en pacientes sin signos clínicos de enfermedad después del tratamiento adyuvante?', 'El enfoque «Observar y esperar» ha sido estudiado ampliamente por el grupo del Dr. Habr-Gama en Sao Paulo.', 'Refirieron que a los pacientes con cáncer rectal distal resecable se les ofreció una vigilancia estricta si presentaban respuesta clínica completa según la resonancia magnética y la endoscopia un año después de haber completado la radioquimioterapia.', 'Se observó una respuesta clínica completa en el 27% de los pacientes, que pudieron evitar la EMT.', 'Se encontró recurrencia locorregional en 25% de los pacientes, todos los cuales se sometieron a cirugía de rescate exitosa.', 'Otros estudios demuestran altas tasas de preservación rectal y recuperación exitosa de la recidiva local, pero fueron admitidos debido al pequeño tamaño de la muestra, la heterogeneidad de las poblaciones de estudio y el seguimiento relativamente corto.', 'En este trabajo se presenta un análisis retrospectivo de una base de datos internacional de alrededor de 1000 pacientes con cáncer rectal manejados con el enfoque «Observar y esperar».', 'Con una notificación similar, el 25% de los pacientes presentó recidiva local después de una mediana de seguimiento de tres años y tan solo el 8% presentó recidiva a distancia.', 'Además, el 88% de las recidivas se diagnosticaron en los dos primeros años.', 'El 97% estaban localizadas en la pared intestinal.', 'En consecuencia, la resección quirúrgica puede evitarse en algunos pacientes.', 'Como mensaje final, el manejo multidisciplinario es esencial.', 'La respuesta patológica completa es ahora un factor pronóstico.', 'La quimioterapia neoadyuvante está validada actualmente en el cáncer rectal local avanzado.', 'El abordaje con TNT ofrece una mejora en la tasa de respuesta patológica completa, y el tratamiento se ha seleccionado de acuerdo con los factores de riesgo de los pacientes.', 'Eso es todo.', 'Gracias.', 'Muchas gracias, Katia.', 'Ha sido un muy buen resumen general del papel del oncólogo médico en el cáncer rectal.', 'El Dr. Zahel Lakkis, nuestro cirujano que también está participando en esta sección, tendrá la oportunidad de comentar al final.', 'Me gustaría preguntar ahora a la profesora Gambacorta de Roma, Italia, una ciudad que me gusta mucho, y he estado allí 10 veces, para hablarnos resumidamente sobre el radiooncólogo.', 'Bien.', 'Muchas gracias, Dr. Bezerra, y muchas gracias, Katia Roque Pérez, por esta presentación tan interesante.', 'Y bien, solo voy a señalar algunos aspectos del tratamiento de radioterapia.', 'Ahora sabemos que el tratamiento estándar para curar el cáncer rectal, está representado por la cirugía de EMT.', 'Y la radioterapia y la quimioterapia se pueden administrar antes o después de la cirugía, intentando mejorar los resultados oncológicos y también la calidad de vida.', 'Como nos mostró la Dra. Pérez, tenemos dos maneras principales de administrar radioterapia, que es el ciclo corto seguido de cirugía inmediata, con cirugía practicada en la semana posterior al final de la radioterapia, que dura cinco días. Y se termina en una semana, y la radioquimioterapia de ciclo largo, donde se utiliza una dosis diaria más pequeña de radioterapia administrada en cinco semanas a una dosis de entre 45 y 50, junto con quimioterapia concomitante, y luego hay que esperar entre seis y ocho semanas antes de practicar la cirugía.', 'Así que este fue el tema del llamado estudio de primera generación.', 'Este estudio de primera generación se inició con un ciclo corto, se comparó con la cirugía sola y donde la radioquimioterapia preoperatoria de ciclo largo se comparó con la radioquimioterapia posoperatoria o la radioterapia preoperatoria.', 'El objetivo era ver si había un aumento en los resultados a largo plazo, y el ensayo que la radioterapia o la radioquimioterapia en comparación con la radioterapia sola, aumentó la tasa de control local.', 'Sin embargo, no aumentaron la supervivencia sin enfermedad ni la supervivencia global, excepto en dos ensayos.', 'El primero es el de Suecia, en el que se practicó cirugía sin escisión mesorrectal total.', 'Fue antes de la introducción de la escisión mesorrectal total, y el segundo es el ensayo holandés, que es un ensayo que se realizó en pacientes con tumores irresecables.', 'Entonces, el primer mensaje que quiero que recuerden es que la radioterapia preoperatoria o la radioquimioterapia preoperatoria administrada junto con la cirugía, que es el tratamiento correctivo en el cáncer rectal, aumentan el control local.', 'La otra cosa que quería decir, volviendo a la diapositiva anterior es que con la radioterapia de ciclo corto seguida de cirugía inmediata, se puede obtener un mayor control local, mientras que se administra quimiorradiación preoperatoria seguida de cirugía tardía por dos razones.', 'La primera es porque se intensifica, y la segunda es porque se espera a la reducción del tumor, también se puede lograr una reducción del estadio.', 'Y la reducción del estadio es importante por dos razones.', 'En primer lugar, es mejorar los resultados de los pacientes, de hecho, ya saben, que un tumor en la fascia mesorrectal o cuando tienes márgenes de resección positivos después de la cirugía, estos pueden disminuir los resultados a largo plazo en términos de recurrencia local, metástasis y supervivencia global.', 'Entonces, ya saben que cuando se administra radioquimioterapia pre-operatoria, retrasamos la cirugía.', 'Se consigue bajar la estadificación del tumor que se desplaza desde la fascia mesorrectal.', 'Así, en ese caso, podemos obtener más resección con margen de resección circunferencial negativo.', 'Esto puede mejorar el control local, disminuir las metástasis a distancia y mejorar la supervivencia global.', 'Y esto quedó demostrado en el ensayo sueco.', 'Este es un enfoque en el ensayo sueco, que fue un ensayo en el que hubo un aumento del control local, las metástasis a distancia, y la supervivencia específica del cáncer para aquellos pacientes que recibieron radioquimioterapia, [comparado con aquellos que recibieron radioterapia preoperatoria sola], que obtuvieron una tasa mayor de resección R0.', 'Por lo tanto, la quimiorradiación preoperatoria al proporcionar una bajada de la estadificación del tumor, permite tener una mayor resección R0 y resultados a largo plazo.', 'No sólo el control local, sino también las metástasis a distancia.', 'Por otro lado, si pensamos en este ensayo de primera generación, sabemos que un tumor puede reducirse también en su longitud.', 'Así, en la longitud del tumor, y en el caso de que el tumor se aleje de la unión anorrectal, los pacientes pueden someterse a cirugía con preservación del esfínter.', 'Sin embargo, en ensayos aleatorizados en la preservación del esfínter en aquellos pacientes que recibieron radioquimioterapia preoperatoria.', 'Pero... si tienen alguna pregunta, por favor escríbanla en el recuadro del chat.', 'Pero ¿qué pasó con estos estudios? que nos enfrentamos a la respuesta patológica completa.', 'Así pues, lo hemos visto en , que es de alrededor del 20% en el cáncer rectal local avanzado y puede alcanzar el 40% en cánceres más incipientes.', 'Así, los tumores T3 incipientes o tumores T2, los pacientes que logran una respuesta patológica completa y como Katia ya mostró en su presentación, los pacientes que tenían una respuesta patológica completa a la radioquimioterapia preoperatoria también tienen mejores resultados a largo plazo en términos de control local, metástasis a distancia, supervivencia sin enfermedad y supervivencia global.', 'Por lo tanto, los estudios de segunda generación sobre tratamientos preoperatorios, especialmente aquellos estudios con radioquimioterapia de ciclo largo se concentraron en el tratamiento intensificado.', '¿Cómo?', 'Mediante la adición de oxaliplatino.', 'Entonces, en el año 2000, nos enfrentamos a estudios en los que se añadió oxaliplatino a 5FU en la radioquimioterapia preoperatoria con el objetivo de mejorar la RPC, y también mejorar la SSE, la supervivencia sin enfermedad.', 'Como pueden ver, no pudieron demostrar el efecto del oxaliplatino, excepto , el ensayo chino y especialmente el alemán, que tiene un aumento de la RPC, y también un aumento de la SSE.', 'Y explicaron estos resultados, bien por una menor toxicidad aguda y un mejor cumplimiento de los pacientes.', 'Por lo tanto, redujeron el número de dosis de oxaliplatino, y también redujeron la dosis de oxaliplatino administrada.', 'Y con este método, tuvieron menos toxicidad aguda y mejor cumplimiento de los pacientes, y esto resultó en mejores resultados a corto y largo plazo.', 'Este aumento de la RPC, ya que la RPC supone mejores resultados a largo plazo, llevó a poner en marcha ensayos y hoy en día, desde 2015 hasta ahora, nos enfrentamos a una gran cantidad de ensayos que están intentando evitar la cirugía.', 'Así, los ensayos y la preservación de órganos que se pueden hacer con un enfoque de «Observar y esperar», o con una escisión local.', 'Y ya, como mostró la Dra. Pérez, por ejemplo, para el enfoque de «Esperar y observar», tenemos muy buenos resultados porque, sabemos que del 20% de los pacientes con respuesta completa, el 25% tienen una recidiva, pero esta recidiva es rescatable, y esta cirugía de rescate conduce a una tasa muy alta de supervivencia global y supervivencia sin enfermedad.', 'También se ha observado que los pacientes con respuesta completa tienen una tasa muy baja de metástasis a distancia, aunque haya que tener cuidado porque los pacientes con recidiva local pueden tener un mayor riesgo de metástasis a distancia en comparación con los pacientes que mantienen una respuesta clínica completa a lo largo del tiempo.', 'Entonces, la idea ahora es cómo aumentar la tasa de pacientes con respuesta clínica completa con respuesta completa.', 'Es la intensificación de la quimioterapia.', 'Y como la Dra. Pérez nos mostró, nos estamos moviendo hacia la terapia neoadyuvante total, donde hemos visto que parece ser mejor, la quimioterapia de consolidación, es decir, quimioterapia después de la radioterapia, que la quimioterapia neoadyuvante.', 'Por lo tanto, es mejor consolidar en lugar de utilizar quimioterapia antes de la radioterapia o la radioquimioterapia.', 'La segunda forma de mejorar es el aumento escalonado de la dosis, que mencionó de nuevo la Dra. Pérez, era aumentar el tiempo entre el final de la radioterapia y la cirugía y nos enfrentamos a varios ensayos también de radioquimioterapia que también cambian del cáncer rectal avanzado local a tumores incipientes.', 'Así que me saltaré la intensificación de la quimioterapia porque la Dra. Pérez ya nos mostró muchos resultados y pasaremos al aumento escalonado de dosis en radioterapia.', 'Como radiooncóloga, sabemos que cuanto mayor es la dosis, mayor es la respuesta del tumor por una parte, y cuanto más alto y mayor es el volumen del tumor, mayor es la dosis que hay que administrar.', 'Entonces, ¿cuál es la dosis que debemos administrar?', 'Se ha visto que para obtener una respuesta completa en el 50% de los pacientes hay que administrar dosis muy altas de hasta 90 Gy.', 'Hay que tener en cuenta que hoy en día la dosis que administramos en radioterapia preoperatoria de quimiorradiación, la norma es de 45 a 50 Gy.', 'En más casos, podemos llegar hasta los 55 Gy y ahora hay ensayos que llegan hasta los 60 Gy. son más de 60 Gy.', 'Puede tener una mayor tasa de respuesta patológica completa con la misma tasa de toxicidad aguda.', '¿Y cómo podemos mejorar la dosis?', 'De dos maneras.', 'Una forma es la llamada radioterapia de intensidad modulada, les mostraré más adelante cómo funciona, mediante la cual podemos dirigir diferentes dosis a las dianas de acuerdo a la carga tumoral, podamos tratar el volumen donde pensamos que hay células tumorales microscópicas con una dosis menor y al mismo tiempo podamos administrar una dosis mayor en lo que llamamos GTV, el volumen tumoral bruto, el tumor macroscópico, pero también logramos dosis aún mayores utilizando terapias locales, una de estas es la braquiterapia.', 'Es una técnica de radioterapia donde se pone la fuente, la fuente de radiación, con un aplicador directamente en contacto con el tumor.', 'La terapia de contacto, que es una superficie, una especie de radioterapia de superficie, donde se administran dosis muy altas de rayos X de baja energía, y se puede eliminar el tumor capa por capa.', 'Y con esta técnica, tienes muy pocas toxicidades agudas porque solo irradias el tumor, evitando completamente los tejidos normales.', 'Por otro lado, está el tiempo.', 'Este es un metanálisis que hemos hecho en, creo, siete ensayos aleatorizados realizados en Europa para medir la tasa de respuesta patológica completa.', 'Según el tiempo, hemos visto que el 95% de la RPC aparece después de 10 semanas, y después de la semana 16 tenemos una meseta.', 'Si quieren esperar a tener un mayor número de RPC deben esperar más de 10 semanas. Este es el mensaje después de la quimiorradiación preoperatoria.', 'Y bien, quiero terminar con los avances en radioterapia.', 'No sé si ustedes, en la audiencia, no creo que sean todos radiooncólogos, pero saben que cuando hoy en día, los radiooncólogos, cuando hablamos de la administración de radioterapia, hablamos de la intensidad de la radioterapia modulada, o radioterapia volumétrica modulada, que es una forma de modular, de disminuir la dosis al órgano en riesgo y modular la dosis dentro de los diferentes volúmenes que irradiamos.', 'El segundo avance que tuvimos fue la obtención de imágenes de a bordo.', 'O sea, como radiooncólogos, trabajamos con imágenes porque tenemos que apuntar los rayos a la diana, así que tenemos que trabajar con imágenes.', 'Y hoy en día, tenemos la posibilidad de ver el tumor, no usamos imágenes sólo para la planificación, sino que usamos la obtención de imágenes también durante el tratamiento.', 'Y les mostraré cuáles son las imágenes de a bordo que hoy tenemos disponibles en nuestras máquinas para ver el tumor mientras lo irradiamos.', 'Y la tercera es, y esto puede ayudarles, adaptar la radioterapia.', 'Eso significa que no decidimos la dosis de radiación al inicio del tratamiento, sino que podemos modular la dosis en función de la respuesta del tumor durante el tratamiento, y usaré tres ejemplos.', 'La primera es lo que llamamos radioterapia de intensidad modulada.', 'En la radioterapia 3D el volumen objetivo está incluido está todo incluido en el campo, sin embargo, parte de los órganos en riesgo, están incluidos en la dosis alta de radioterapia.', 'En la modulación de la intensidad de la dosis de radioterapia, podemos preservar los órganos en riesgo, especialmente aquellos que se encuentran dentro del volumen objetivo.', 'Podemos modular la dosis en los tumores, dando menos dosis donde queremos erradicar las células tumorales microscópicas y dosis más altas donde el tumor está presente.', '¿De acuerdo?', 'La segunda cosa es la siguiente.', 'Esta es la radioterapia guiada por imágenes.', 'Hoy en día, tenemos disponible en nuestro departamento esta máquina que está cada vez más extendida por el mundo, que es una máquina híbrida en la que tenemos un acelerador lineal junto con una resonancia magnética.', 'Se llama MRI-LINAC. Con esto, podemos ver el tumor durante cada cómo se mueve.', 'La línea azul es que si el tumor se sale del azul, la máquina deja de administrar la dosis.', 'Esto significa que se puede preservar el órgano en riesgo y disminuir el margen alrededor del tumor.', 'Hoy en día, el paciente puede ver dónde está el tumor.', 'Por lo tanto, especialmente no en el caso del cáncer rectal, pero especialmente para aquellos tumores, que se encuentran en el hígado o en el pulmón, pueden controlar su respiración para permitir que el tumor permanezca dentro de la línea azul.', 'Y también podemos ver lo que sucede a lo largo del tratamiento.', 'Como pueden ver, este es el tumor en la primera semana de tratamiento, la segunda, tercera, cuarta, quinta y al final del tratamiento.', 'Se puede ver que el tumor disminuye de tamaño durante el tratamiento.', 'Además, como saben hoy en día tenemos la radiómica.', 'La radiómica es una forma de leer cuantitativamente, no sé cómo se dice, las imágenes de RM.', 'Así, por ejemplo, en este caso, observando la reducción del tumor y midiendo la radiómica en determinado momento, lo que podemos hacer es adaptar la dosis de acuerdo con la previsión de la respuesta tumoral.', 'Y este es un ensayo, un ensayo monocéntrico de fase II que estamos llevando a cabo en nuestra institución con este MRI_LINAC, pacientes con cáncer rectal, con un estadio intermedio de cáncer rectal.', 'Así, T2, T2 N1, o T3 N0 N1, o T4 N0. reciben tratamiento con quimiorradiación preoperatoria.', 'Luego, en la segunda semana, vamos a medir el volumen y hacemos la radiómica en la imagen, y hacemos la radiómica delta entre el inicio y el tratamiento a las dos semanas.', 'Así que si vemos que el tumor responde, tenemos una alta probabilidad de respuesta completa.', 'Si este es el caso, el paciente puede continuar con la dosis inicial.', 'Si podemos, si nuestra previsión es que el tumor no va a alcanzar una respuesta completa, le damos un refuerzo durante el tratamiento, llegamos hasta los 60 Gy.', 'Eso significa que modulamos la dosis, según la respuesta del tumor.', 'Así que adaptamos el tratamiento al comportamiento del tumor justo durante el tratamiento.', 'Eso es solo para decir que el mensaje con el que deben quedarse acerca del papel de la radioterapia es que sabemos que la radioterapia hoy en día aumenta el control local, y como Katia nos mostró, la respuesta completa después de la quimiorradiación se relaciona con mejores resultados.', 'Y en esos pacientes tratamos de evitar la cirugía para mejorar la calidad de vida.', 'Y la forma de aumentar la respuesta completa es mediante la intensificación, es decir, TNT, o la dosis de radioterapia, o también podemos aumentar el desfase, el tiempo entre el final del tratamiento preoperatorio y que desde el punto de vista de los radiooncólogos, y que desde el punto de vista de los radiooncólogos, quería mostrarles nuevas tecnologías que pueden ayudarnos a mejorar de acuerdo con la respuesta del tumor.', 'Muchas gracias por su atención.', 'Muchas gracias, Maria.', 'Fue una presentación muy, muy interesante.', 'Creo que tenemos una muy buena visión general de cómo podemos tratar a los pacientes de cáncer rectal de una manera multidisciplinaria.', 'Me gustaría darle la palabra al profesor Zahel Lakkis para entender un poco su percepción como cirujano, cómo podemos colocar la radioquimioterapia antes, después.', 'Me gustaría conocer un poco su opinión sobre las estrategias de TNT para tratar a los pacientes.', 'Así que, por favor, denos su opinión.', 'Gracias, Ramon.', 'En primer lugar, me gustaría felicitar a ambas presentaciones porque fueron diapositivas de muy, muy buena calidad.', 'Y aprendí mucho sobre nuevas tecnologías en radioterapia, así que muchas gracias.', 'Antes de las preguntas, tal vez, solo tengo un comentario.', 'Aquí en Francia, hemos adoptado el ensayo Prodige-23.', 'De hecho, muy pocos centros usan el protocolo de Rápido por muchas razones, pero como cirujano, ahora tengo que explicarle a un paciente que tendrá tres meses de quimioterapia, luego un mes, cinco semanas de radioterapia, luego esperar dos meses, luego cirugía, luego tiene que recuperarse de la cirugía, luego tres meses de quimioterapia, luego, hay que cerrar el estoma.', 'Así que, para cada vez más pacientes jóvenes en especial, que tienen que soportar un TNT, estamos hablando de un protocolo de un año de hecho, y no es una pregunta, es sólo una observación de que en algunos casos podría ser muy difícil para los pacientes dejar cualquier trabajo, cualquier vida social casi.', 'Bueno, esto es solo un comentario, pero los resultados son muy, muy buenos.', 'De hecho, estamos mejorando la supervivencia del paciente y ahora tenemos, y esta es mi verdadera preocupación, mi principal preocupación, tenemos ahora casi el 30% de respuesta completa cuando hacemos una EMT.', 'Así que mi pregunta sería, tal vez para ambas, ¿cómo podríamos evitar ahora el 30% de EMT innecesarias en pacientes con T3 N0 o T2 N1, deberíamos todavía realizar una EMT en todos los pacientes con sospecha de respuesta clínica completa después de los protocolos de TNT?', '¿Qué opinan al respecto?', 'Porque creo que como cirujano, hago un 30% de cirugías casi innecesarias.', 'Maria y Katia, ¿quieren opinar?', 'Adelante Katia, adelante Katia. DRA.', 'Bien.', 'En ESCO 2020, presentaron los resultados preliminares del ensayo, que es un ensayo de fase III, que evalúa un cáncer rectal en estadio 2 o 3, que recibió un tratamiento neoadyuvante total y FOLFOX o CAPOX como terapia de inducción o consolidación, seguido de un enfoque de observación y espera con un año de seguimiento.', 'Tenemos resultados preliminares a los dos años de seguimiento, que indican que el 58% de los pacientes del grupo de consolidación conservan el esfínter.', 'Y hay resultados prometedores, y estamos esperando más datos.', 'Pero creo que observar y esperar es una buena alternativa para pacientes con cáncer rectal distal y pacientes muy jóvenes, cuya calidad de vida es una prioridad que desarrollar.', 'Maria, ¿qué opina?', 'Estoy de acuerdo, porque hay un 30% de pacientes que logran una respuesta completa, pero por otro lado, hay un 70% de pacientes que no la logran.', 'Estos pacientes reciben un tratamiento muy, muy largo y al final terminan sometiéndose a una EMT, así que tenemos que considerar ambos.', 'Lo que es, en mi opinión, lo que tenemos que perseguir es, en caso de que la pregunta del Dr. Lakis fuera, en estos pacientes con respuesta completa, ¿tenemos que evitar la EMT?', 'Creo que sí.', 'Sin embargo, creo que hoy en día no tenemos una herramienta real para predecir cuáles serán los pacientes que responderán.', 'Así que este es el camino que tenemos que seguir, creo, en el futuro.', 'Entonces, modelo predictivo, tratando de predecir quién responderá y quién no, porque en este caso, podemos seleccionar aquellos pacientes que responderán y seleccionar aquellos pacientes que nunca responderán.', 'Y en este caso, podrían ir directamente a una EMT con mejor resultado funcional en comparación con aquellos pacientes que reciben tratamiento preoperatorio más EMT, junto con un período largo de tratamiento.', '¿Saben?', 'Entonces, creo que el camino a seguir es, optar por un modelo de predicción para tratar de seleccionar mejor a aquellos pacientes que pueden ser tratados con radioterapia sola, radioterapia o radioquimioterapia, con radioterapia y quimioterapia para evitar la cirugía, y aquellos pacientes en los que evitar todos estos tratamientos e ir directamente a LA EMT porque en algunos pacientes T3 N0, LA EMT es suficiente y tendrán también buenos resultados, especialmente los del recto medio, o del recto alto.', 'Sí.', 'Sí.', 'Estoy totalmente de acuerdo con usted.', 'Creo que podemos ser menos nocivos para los pacientes y posiblemente tratar de predecir qué tipo de respuesta tendrán; ayudará a tomar estas mejores decisiones en el futuro.', 'Y tal vez, si puedo hacerles una pregunta más, no sé, en su experiencia, pero en la mía, tenemos cada vez más pacientes jóvenes que hace 5, 10 o 15 años.', 'Y en mi experiencia, me encuentro pacientes con tumores, con diferenciación mucinosa, y tengo la sensación de que esos tumores no tienen la misma respuesta con FOLFOX o FOLFIRINOX e incluso con radioquimioterapia, y estos pacientes son los más jóvenes, intensificamos los tratamientos, pero esos tumores realmente responden mal.', '¿Y creen que tenemos que intensificar cada vez más los tratamientos aumentando la dosis de radiación?', 'Porque esos tumores para mí, en mi práctica, son muy, muy problemáticos.', 'Y creo que vamos a tener cada vez más pacientes con estos tipos de tumores.', 'No sé por qué, tal vez sean ciertos cambios de comportamiento en nuestra dieta, o qué, pero creo que es realmente, porque esos pacientes no estaban involucrados e incluidos en ensayos anteriores.', 'Hace 15 o 20 años, esos tumores eran muy raros.', 'Y ahora tengo la sensación de que nos enfrentamos cada vez a más tumores mucinosos.', '¿A qué tipo de tumor se refiere?', 'Tumores mucinosos colorrectales diferenciados.', 'Ah, el mucinoso.', 'Estos tumores mucinosos son muy difíciles de tratar.', 'Sí.', 'Y suelen desarrollar metástasis muy pronto y también en lugares impredecibles, he visto metástasis en la piel, en el riñón, y realmente no lo sé porque normalmente esos tumores con muchas mucinas, no, a veces, no responden.', 'Otras veces, ellos, se ve que aparentemente no responden, y luego en el espécimen patológico, se ve solo mucinas y no se ven células tumorales, pero estoy completamente de acuerdo con usted, lo cual es muy difícil.', 'Podría ser que estos pacientes, dado que desarrollan metástasis antes, o en lugares imprevistos, podrían ser, se les podría dar prioridad a la quimioterapia.', 'No lo sé.', 'No sé si Katia tiene una idea de cómo tratar estos tumores. DRA.', 'Es un tumor muy complicado de tratar.', 'No tenemos muchos casos, pero los casos que tenemos, normalmente con una enfermedad muy voluminosa y avanzada.', 'En realidad, el mucinoso es muy, no es tan quimiosensible, y suponen un desafío para este tipo de enfoque.', 'Y así.', 'No, normalmente estos tumores son, corríjame si me equivoco, Katia, estos tumores suelen tener la mutación de BRAF, tienen BRAF mutado, según mi experiencia.', 'No sé si en el futuro desarrollaremos una molécula que vaya contra este tumor.', 'Creo que hay algunos oncólogos médicos, hay algunos estudios de este sentido tratando de seleccionar a estos pacientes desde el punto de vista mutacional.', 'Sí, creo.', 'Muy bien.', 'Creo que se nos ha acabado el tiempo, me gustaría felicitar a todos los que participaron aquí en esta sección multidisciplinaria para el cáncer rectal, creo que ha sido apasionante tratar con ustedes varios aspectos de esta enfermedad.', 'Que es muy difícil de tratar como hemos visto aquí.', 'Quisiera dar las gracias a todos los oradores, a todos los miembros del panel, aquí presentes, a la Dra.

            "['Así que voy a hablar sobre la importancia de la atención multidisciplinar.', 'como escuchaste mi nombre es ann partridge', \"i'm a medical oncologist at dana-farber where i focus on breast cancer in young women in particular\", \"and i can't emphasize enough the importance of multidisciplinary care for all patients with breast cancer but particularly for young patients\", \"and i'll give you an example of why from my own practice as well as discuss a little bit of the history and what it entails\", \"we've known for decades that multidisciplinary care makes a difference\", 'Back in the late 80s, the UK government actually commissioned a report, the Forrest report, which proposed new principles of screening for breast cancer.', 'among these principles were that patients with a high clinical index of suspicion for a cancer diagnosis should receive the triple assessment and that included a clinical exam radiologic review of images and once a biopsy is done histopathological analysis of tissue samples', 'Y concluyeron que la evaluación de las anomalías detectadas por la pantalla requiere técnicas especializadas.', 'and these techniques are best carried out by a skilled multidisciplinary team', 'this team should consist of a clinician a radiologist and a pathologist all trained in the diagnosis of breast disease supported by a radiographer a nurse and a receptionist', 'The availability of such teams is an essential prerequisite of a screening service for breast cancer.', 'so that was kind of the beginning of the formal recognition of the importance of the different parts that different individuals with different expertise might play for an individual with a diagnosis of of breast cancer', 'and subsequently over the many decades many nations have adopted a multidisciplinary approach to care in various shapes and forms', 'En los Estados Unidos, donde practico, muchos hospitales comenzaron a hacer lo que se llamaba tableros de tumores.', 'and this is where groups of experts meet and review patient cases assign diagnoses and then decide together programs of care to offer to the patient', \"of course the approach varies from center to center but many include an attending level physician a surgeon pathologist radiologist and oncologist are often involved with very ball involvement of specialist nurses allied health professionals and we'll get into some examples that are particularly pertinent for young women\", 'sometimes patient representatives are at these formal tumor boards', 'Y luego, raramente, los pacientes mismos son invitados a las juntas de tumores.', \"although this is less frequent and especially in where privacy concerns come up you don't want a patient in the room when we're talking about other patients\", 'so that can become quite tricky both from a confidentiality standpoint and also from a logistics standpoint for many of these things', 'how do they typically work and do they work', 'well there were data that have evolved over the years that suggest that they do indeed work', 'Este es uno de los primeros estudios que se realizaron en Michigan en los Estados Unidos.', 'and the question they asked was multidisciplinary breast cancer clinics', '¿Funcionan?', 'this was conducted at the henry ford hospital in detroit and they developed themselves like many at the time were doing in the in the nineties a multidisciplinary breast clinic the m d b c c to offer one-stop shopping consultation and support for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients', 'And they did a historical control approach.', \"so they compared the first one hundred and seventy seven patients seen in their new multidisciplinary clinic to one hundred and sixty two controls who'd been seen in the year before in the traditional sequential manner where a patient would go and see the surgeon and then maybe after the surgery unless the surgeon thought they might need preoperative therapy they'd send them to the medical oncologist and the radiation oncologist as treatment has evolved\", 'and there may or may not be a nurse involved', 'Podría haber otros proveedores involucrados.', 'and they did a retrospective chart review to assess the treatment timeliness', 'you know how quickly did people make it into their care and their treatment', 'as well as to assess patient satisfaction.', \"and we know that treatment timeliness in many settings does indeed matter matter and it's also a marker of of quality care\", \"and what they found was that their multidisciplinary breast cancer clinic increased patient satisfaction by encouraging involvement of patients' families and friends and by helping patients to make treatment decisions which is a really important thing to make a treatment decision that's consonant with a patient's preferences and values\", 'but importantly it also decreased the time between diagnosis and the initiation of treatment', 'ah you can see a pretty substantial average decrease of about twelve days and highly significant in terms of the statistical testing', \"so this was one of the first data to show that it matters in terms of pretty important outcomes patient satisfaction as well as time to initiation of treatment which can impact on the effect of treatment and the patient's disease outcomes we've now shown\", 'Y así, en estos días, hay muchos miembros potenciales del equipo multidisciplinario, especialmente cuando se piensa en las mujeres jóvenes.', \"And I'm just going to talk you through this schema a little bit.\", 'and of course different clinics structure things differently', 'sometimes the person is seen by multiple people on the same day in the same clinic', 'sometimes a woman is seen over a course of a few days or

            "[\"So, I'm gonna talk about the importance of multidisciplinary care.\", 'As you heard, my name is Ann Partridge.', \"I'm a medical oncologist at Dana-Farber, where I focus on breast cancer in young women, in particular.\", \"And I can't emphasize enough the importance of multidisciplinary care for all patients with breast cancer, but particularly for young patients.\", \"And I'll give you an example of why, from my own practice, as well as discuss a little bit of the history and what it entails.\", \"We've known for decades that multidisciplinary care makes a difference.\", 'Back in late 80s, the UK government actually commissioned a report, The Forrest Report, which proposed new principles of screening for breast cancer.', 'Among these principles were the patients with a high clinical index of suspicion for a cancer diagnosis, should receive the triple-assessment, and that included a clinical exam, radiologic review of images, and once a biopsy is done, histopathological analysis of tissue samples.', 'And they concluded that the assessment of screen detected abnormalities requires specialized techniques.', 'And these techniques are best carried out by a skilled multidisciplinary team.', 'This team should consist of a clinician, a radiologist, and a pathologist, all trained in the diagnosis of breast disease, supported by a radiographer, a nurse, and receptionist.', 'The availability of such teams is an essential prerequisite of a screening service for breast cancer.', 'So, that was kind of the beginning of the formal recognition of the importance of the different parts that, different individuals, with different expertise, might play for an individual with a diagnosis of breast cancer.', 'And, subsequently, over the many decades, many nations have adopted a multidisciplinary approach to care in various shapes and forms.', 'In the US, where I practice, many hospitals started doing what was called tumor boards.', 'And this is where groups of experts meet and review patient cases, assign diagnoses, and then decide together programs of care to offer to the patient.', \"Of course, the approach varies from center to center, but many include an attending level physician, a surgeon, pathologist, radiologist and oncologist are often involved, with variable involvement of specialists, nurses, allied health professionals, and we'll get into some examples that are particularly pertinent for young women.\", 'Sometimes patient representatives are at these formal tumor boards.', 'And, then, rarely, patients themselves are invited to the tumor boards.', \"Although, this is less frequent, and especially where privacy concerns come up, you don't want a patient in the room when we're talking about other patients.\", 'So. that can become quite tricky, both from a confidentiality standpoint, and also from a logistics standpoint, for many of these things.', 'How do they typically work, and do they work?', 'Well, there were data that have evolved over the years that suggest that they do indeed work.', 'This is one of the first studies that was conducted in Michigan in the United States.', 'And the question they asked was, \" Multidisciplinary breast cancer clinics.', 'Do they work?\"', 'This was conducted at the Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, and they developed themselves, like many at the time were doing, in the 90s, a multidisciplinary breast clinic, the MDBCC, to offer one-stop- shopping, consultation and support for newly diagnosed breast cancer patients.', 'And they did a historical control approach.', \"So, they compared the first 177 patients, seen in their new multidisciplinary clinic, to 162 controls who had been seen in the year before in the traditional sequential manner, where a patient would go and see the surgeon, and then maybe after the surgery, unless the surgeon thought they might need preoperative therapy, they'd send them to the medical oncologist, and the radiation oncologist, as treatment has evolved.\", 'And there may or may not be a nurse involved.', 'There might be other providers involved.', 'And they did a retrospective chart review to assess the treatment timeliness.', 'You know, how quickly did people make it into their care and their treatments?', \"As well as to assess patients' satisfaction.\", \"And we know that treatment timeliness in many settings does indeed matter, and it's also a marker of quality care.\", \"And what they found was that their multidisciplinary breast cancer clinic increased patient satisfaction by encouraging involvement of patient's families and friends, and by helping patients to make treatment decisions, which is a really important thing, to make a treatment decision that's consonant with a patient's preferences and values.\", 'But, importantly, it also decreased the time between diagnosis and the initiation of treatment.', 'You can see a pretty substantial average decrease of about 12 days, and highly significant in terms of the statistical testing.', \"So, this was one of the first data to show that it matters, in terms of pretty important outcomes, patient satisfaction, as well as, time to initiation of treatment, which can impact on the effect of treatment and on the patient's disease outcomes, we've now shown.\", 'And so, these days, there are many potential members of the multidisciplinary team, especially when you think about young women.', \"And I'm just going to talk you through this schema a little bit.\", 'And, of course, different clinics structure things differently.', 'Sometimes, the person is seen by multiple people on the same day, in the same clinic.', 'Sometimes, a woman is seen over a course of a few days or sequentially when appropriate.', \"And again, I'll walk you through a patient example in a little bit.\", \"But these days, depending on woman's issues, and needs, and her disease, you start potentially with the breast surgeon, because that's often the person who sent the biopsy initially, but then you also might need the plastic surgeon pretty soon, if the surgeon says, hey, you might need more than just a lumpectomy, or you might need some oncoplastic surgery.\", 'The medical oncologist, of course, wants to weigh in, radiation oncologist, if radiation is to be considered, and the patient is candidate.', 'Radiologist early on for the breast imaging, especially in screen detected malignancy.', 'Pathologists to look at the tissue.', 'Tissue is the issue.', 'For our younger women who have not completed their families, a fertility specialist.', \"We know that we want to get that person in early to talk to the fertility specialist, to make sure that they don't burn a bridge and they don't miss out on the opportunity to preserve fertility if they're going to be getting treatments that will either decrease their fertility or where they'll have to wait.\", 'And for almost every young woman, there is often treatment that makes them wait at least to some degree.', 'Genetic counseling, important for many breast cancer patients these days, but especially our younger patients where the likelihood of having a genetic predisposition is higher.', 'We get the genetic counselors in early, many, on the same time, they get diagnosed, and they see the surgeon, the medical oncologist, and the genetic counselor that day, because that can impact on their treatment decisions with regard to local therapy.', 'And, increasingly, at this point, for women with metastatic disease, it can impact on their treatment choices systemically.', \"And we'll see if the ongoing studies suggest that it should also impact on their treatment choices in the adjuvant setting.\", 'A research team is also involved often, in the multidisciplinary care, particularly, when there are research opportunities that the patient might avail themself of.', 'Physical therapy, should they be debilitated from the treatment or the cancer itself.', 'And then we have the psychosocial supports, like oncology psychologist, or social worker, and others.', 'Nutrition, nursing, of course, plays a fundamental role in the care of our patients, and other ancillary groups, as well as, patient support groups often can weigh in.', 'Now, I have not seen, in my practice a patient support group directly in the clinic, but we have many one-to-one and support groups that we bring in very quickly when we can, especially for our young patients.', 'And in the COVID era, we do it a lot of that virtually, of course, which we were doing virtually anyway just for the patient convenience.', \"So, that's often the members.\", \"I'm sure I'm missing some.\", \"And in the discussion, it would be great to hear who I'm missing here, so, I can further round out this graphic.\", \"But I promised a patient-example, this really was a patient I saw last week, I've even changed the initials.\", 'DD is a 40-year-old woman who presented with a left breast mass.', 'She first noticed the mass in her breast on June, 2020.', 'And over the next few weeks, she noted that the mass increased in size, such that by August, she was referred for a workup.', \"She's otherwise healthy, denies any previous breast concerns, imaging or biopsies, and she had no rash, pruritis, pain, or nipple discharge, just a growing mass on her left breast.\", 'She underwent a diagnostic mammogram at an outside medical center, an academic medical center, in late August, which showed a two- centimeter lesion by report in the superior breast at the site of the palpable concern.', 'And this was associated with some upper pleomorphic or calcifications that were irregular.', 'And then she also had smaller satellite nodules that were noted adjacent to the dominant lesion.', 'And an ultrasound showed a two-centimeter dominant mass with spiculated margins, highly suspicious for malignancy.', 'She underwent a biopsy that day, or a few days later, which showed an invasive ductal carcinoma, or cancer Grade 3 or high grade, and there was associated non-invasive DCIS, and the tumor was hormone receptor negative, ER negative and PR negative, and HER2/ neu 3 plus or positive by IHC.', 'So, she did indeed have breast cancer, not surprising given the story, certainly surprising to her and her family.', 'She saw a surgeon at that outside academic hospital as her first stop, referred by radiology.', 'And he recommended that she just go straight to surgery for lumpectomy and sentinel node evaluation.', 'And, fortunately, she came down and saw us the next week.', 'And that was a good thing, because we changed her plan.', 'So, she saw the surgeon that I work with, and a surgical NP with us.', 'As part of our multidisciplinary practice, every patient that comes in as a newly diagnosed patient who has not yet had their surgery, or has issues there, is seen by both a surgeon and a medical oncologist, ideally on the same day.', \"And that's usually the way it works.\", 'And sometimes a radiation oncologist on the same day.', 'And so, she saw the surgeon first and her team.', 'And then she saw me with a fellow, along with a genetic counselor who followed us.', \"And we all talked in the back room before and after we've reviewed her records and seen the patient, while the patient is there, especially when things are not straightforward.\", 'But even when they are straightforward, we still do a pass off from the surgeon to me or vice versa.', \"The other nice thing about our multidisciplinary practice is we've been doing it for a number of years.\", \"So, the surgeon often knows what I'm gonna recommend, and even the studies I might think about, and vice versa.\", \"I know often what she's gonna recommend.\", \"We obviously always check it, and we talk to the patient, and say, I think she'll want to do this, but wait until she sees you, because, you know, I could be wrong, because we allow for that person from the discipline to use their expertise.\", \"So, we had reviewed her outside imaging together with radiology, prior to seeing the patient, and had our pathology reviewed by our pathologist's.\", \"Note the multidiscipline, those people aren't in the room.\", \"Now they're very virtual, but they had already seen her images and her pathology.\", 'And so, we were able to have that extra view.', 'And on imaging, we, actually, our radiologist saw another lesion in the same breast that had not been commented on by the outside hospital, and an MRI was actually recommended to determine whether these two areas were contiguous, which would have made her less likely to be able to have breast preservation upfront.', 'And, then, on imaging exam, even though all the documentation said that the tumor was two centimeters, on exam it was actually four centimeters, taking up a large proportion of her breast, and the subsequent MRI, that she got after she left us, a day or so later, actually, suggested that there was nodal involvement in the underarm, and the areas did appear to be contiguous in the breast.', \"The FNA was done to the node, and I actually don't know the results of that yet.\", 'But we were glad that she had seen us.', \"We saw that extra spot, we got the MRI, she's got a much larger breast cancer than the two centimeters she was billed as.\", 'And the idea of taking

UU., donde ejerzo, muchos hospitales comenzaron a hacer lo que se llamó comités de tumores.', 'Y es aquí donde grupos de expertos se reúnen y revisan casos de pacientes, asignan diagnósticos, y luego deciden juntos programas de atención que ofrecer al paciente.', 'Por supuesto, el enfoque varía de un centro a otro, pero muchos incluyen a menudo la participación de un médico a nivel asistencial, un cirujano, un patólogo, un radiólogo y un oncólogo, con participación variable de especialistas, enfermeros, profesionales relacionados con la salud, y vamos a entrar en algunos ejemplos que son especialmente pertinentes para las mujeres jóvenes.', 'A veces los representantes de los pacientes están en estos comités de tumores formales.', 'Y, luego, en raras ocasiones, los propios pacientes son invitados a los comités de tumores.', 'Aunque esto es menos frecuente, y especialmente cuando surgen problemas de privacidad, no quieres a un paciente en la sala cuando estamos hablando de otros

atendidas el año anterior de la manera secuencial tradicional, donde la paciente iría a ver al cirujano, y luego tal vez después de la cirugía, a menos que el cirujano pensara que podía necesitar terapia preoperatoria, la enviaría al oncólogo médico, y al radiooncólogo, a medida que el tratamiento fuera evolucionado.', 'Y puede o no haber personal de enfermería involucrado.', 'Podría haber otros profesionales involucrados.', 'E hicieron una revisión retrospectiva de historias clínicas para evaluar la puntualidad del tratamiento.', 'Ya saben, ¿con qué rapidez consiguió la gente la atención y los tratamientos?', 'Así como para evaluar la satisfacción de las pacientes.', 'Y sabemos que la puntualidad del tratamiento en muchos contextos sí importa, y también es un indicador de la calidad de la atención.', 'Y lo que encontraron fue que su clínica multidisciplinaria de cáncer de mama aumentó la satisfacción de las pacientes al alentar la participación de sus familiares y amigos, y ayudar a las pacientes a tomar decisiones terapéuticas, lo cual es muy importante, tomar una decisión terapéutica que esté en consonancia con las preferencias y valores de las pacientes.', 'Pero también, y esto es muy importante, redujo el tiempo entre el diagnóstico y el inicio del tratamiento.', 'Se puede ver una disminución promedio bastante sustancial de unos 12 días, y muy significativa en términos de análisis estadístico.', 'Este fue uno de los primeros datos en mostrar que sí importa, en términos de resultados fundamentales, la satisfacción de la paciente, así como el tiempo hasta el inicio del tratamiento, que puede repercutir en el efecto del tratamiento y en los resultados de la enfermedad de la paciente, como hemos demostrado.', 'Y así, en la actualidad, son muchos los posibles miembros del equipo multidisciplinario, sobre todo cuando pensamos en mujeres jóvenes.', 'Y sólo voy a hablarles un poco de este esquema.', 'Por supuesto, las diferentes clínicas estructuran las cosas de diferentes maneras.', 'A veces, la persona es atendida por varias personas el mismo día, en la misma clínica.', 'A veces, se atiende a la mujer en el transcurso de unos días o de forma secuencial cuando es adecuado.', 'Y de nuevo, repasaremos un ejemplo de una paciente dentro de un momento.', 'Pero hoy en día, dependiendo de los problemas de la mujer, y sus necesidades, y su enfermedad, se podría empezar con el cirujano de mama, porque a menudo es la persona que envió la biopsia en un principio, pero entonces también se podría necesitar al cirujano plástico muy pronto, si el cirujano dice, bueno, usted podría necesitar más que solo una mastectomía parcial, o usted podría necesitar cirugía oncoplástica.', 'El oncólogo médico, por supuesto, quiere opinar, el radiooncólogo, si se va a considerar la radioterapia y la paciente es candidata.', 'El radiólogo participa pronto, para obtener imágenes de la mama, especialmente en los tumores detectados mediante cribado.', 'Los patólogos analizan el tejido.', 'La histología es la guía.', 'Para las mujeres más jóvenes que no han terminado de formar una familia, un especialista en fertilidad.', 'Sabemos que queremos que esa persona empiece pronto a hablar con el especialista en fertilidad, para asegurarnos de que no quema un puente y que no pierde la oportunidad de preservar la fertilidad si va a recibir tratamientos que disminuyan la fertilidad o con los que tendrá que esperar.', 'Y para casi todas las mujeres jóvenes, suele haber un tratamiento que las hace esperar al menos hasta cierto punto.', 'Asesoramiento genético, importante para muchas pacientes con cáncer de mama en la actualidad, pero especialmente para las pacientes más jóvenes donde la probabilidad de tener una predisposición genética es mayor.', 'Incorporamos a los asesores genéticos pronto, muchos, a la vez que se las diagnostica, y ese día ven al cirujano, al oncólogo médico, y al asesor genético, porque eso puede afectar a sus decisiones terapéuticas con respecto a la terapia local.', 'Y, cada vez más, en este caso para las mujeres con enfermedad metastásica, podría afectar a sus opciones de tratamiento a nivel sistémico.', 'Y veremos si los estudios en curso sugieren que también debería afectar a sus opciones de tratamiento adyuvante.', 'Un equipo de investigación también participa a menudo, en la atención multidisciplinaria, en particular, cuando existen opciones en investigación de las que la paciente podría beneficiarse.', 'La fisioterapia, si están debilitadas por el tratamiento o el cáncer en sí.', 'Y luego tenemos los apoyos psicosociales, como el psicooncólogo o el trabajador social, entre otros.', 'La nutrición, la enfermería, por supuesto, juega un papel fundamental en el cuidado de nuestras pacientes y otros grupos auxiliares, así como los grupos de apoyo a los pacientes, a menudo pueden intervenir.', 'No he visto en mi práctica profesional un grupo de apoyo al paciente directamente en la clínica, pero tenemos muchos apoyos cara a cara y grupales que incorporamos con rapidez cuando podemos, especialmente para nuestras pacientes jóvenes.', 'Y en la era COVID, hacemos de manera virtual, por supuesto, muchas cosas que hacíamos virtualmente de todas formas solo para comodidad de la paciente.', 'Así que normalmente estos son los miembros.', 'Estoy segura de que me olvido de alguno.', 'Y durante el debate, me encantaría que me dijeran de quién me estoy olvidando, así puedo completar aún más este gráfico.', 'Pero prometí un ejemplo de paciente, esta es una paciente real que vi la semana pasada, e incluso he cambiado las iniciales.', 'DD es una mujer de 40 años que presentó una masa en la mama izquierda.', 'Notó por primera vez la masa en la mama en junio de 2020.', 'Y durante las semanas siguientes, notó que la masa había aumentado de tamaño, de tal manera que, para agosto, fue remitida para un estudio diagnóstico.', 'Por lo demás, está sana, afirma no tener problemas de mama, imágenes diagnósticas o biopsias previas, y no presentó erupción, prurito, dolor ni galactorrea, solo una masa en crecimiento en la mama izquierda.', 'A finales de agosto se le realizó una mamografía diagnóstica en un centro médico externo, un centro médico académico, que reveló una lesión de dos centímetros según el informe en la mama superior en el lugar del problema palpable.', 'Y se asoció con algunas calcificaciones polimorfas que eran irregulares.', 'Y luego también se observaron nódulos satélite más pequeños adyacentes a la lesión dominante.', 'Y una ecografía mostró una masa dominante de 2 centímetros con márgenes espiculados, altamente sospechosa de malignidad.', 'Se sometió a una biopsia ese día, o unos días más tarde, que mostró un carcinoma canalicular invasivo, o cáncer de grado 3 o de grado alto, y se asoció a DCIS no invasivo, y el tumor era negativo para receptores hormonales, negativo para el RE y negativo para el RP, y HER2/neu 3+ o positivo mediante IHQ.', 'Así que, de verdad tenía cáncer de mama, lo que no sorprende dada la historia, aunque fue ciertamente sorprendente para ella y su familia.', 'Vio a un cirujano en ese hospital académico externo como primera parada, derivada por radiología.', 'Y este recomendó que fuera directamente a cirugía para una mastectomía parcial y evaluación de los ganglios centinela.', 'Y, afortunadamente, vino y nos consultó la semana siguiente.', 'Y eso fue estupendo, porque cambiamos el plan.', 'Así que vio al cirujano con el que trabajo, y a una enfermera especialista quirúrgica que trabaja con nosotros.', 'Como parte de nuestra práctica multidisciplinaria, toda paciente que ingresa como paciente recién diagnosticada que aún no se ha sometido cirugía, o que tiene problemas allí, es vista por un cirujano y un oncólogo médico, idealmente el mismo día.', 'Y normalmente así es como funciona.', 'Y a veces un radiooncólogo el mismo día.', 'Así que vio primero a la cirujana y a su equipo.', 'Y luego me vio a mí con un compañero, junto con un asesor genético que nos siguió.', 'Y todos hablamos en la trastienda antes y después de revisar sus registros y ver a la paciente, mientras la paciente está ahí, especialmente cuando las cosas no son sencillas.', 'Pero incluso cuando son sencillas, seguimos haciendo un traspaso de la cirujana a mí o viceversa.', 'Otra cosa buena de nuestra práctica multidisciplinaria es que llevamos muchos años haciéndolo.', 'Por tanto, la cirujana a menudo sabe lo que voy a recomendar, e incluso los estudios en los que podría pensar, y viceversa.', 'Normalmente sé lo que ella va a recomendar.', 'Obviamente siempre lo comprobamos, y hablamos con la paciente, y le decimos, creo que ella querrá hacer esto, pero espera hasta que te vea, porque, ya sabes, podría equivocarme, porque dejamos que ese especialista aplique su experiencia.', 'Así que revisamos su imagen externa junto con radiología, antes de ver a la paciente, y la patología fue revisada por nuestro patólogo.', 'Fíjense en la multidisciplinariedad, esas personas no están en la sala.', 'Ahora son muy virtuales, pero ya habían visto sus imágenes y su patología.', 'Así que pudimos contar con esa visión extra.', 'Y en las imágenes, nosotros, en realidad nuestro radiólogo, vio otra lesión en la misma mama que no había sido comentada por el hospital externo, y se recomendó una resonancia magnética para determinar si estas dos áreas eran contiguas, lo que haría menos probable que pudiera preservar la mama por adelantado.', 'Y, entonces, en el examen mediante las imágenes, aunque toda la documentación decía que el tumor medía 2 centímetros, en el examen medía 4 centímetros, ocupando una gran parte de su mama, y la posterior resonancia magnética, que obtuvo después de irse, alrededor de un día más tarde, de hecho sugería que había afectación ganglionar en la axila, y las áreas parecían ser contiguas en la mama.', 'Se hizo una FNA en el ganglio, y en realidad aún no conozco los resultados.', 'Pero estábamos contentos de que hubiera acudido a nosotros.', 'Vimos esa mancha adicional, hicimos una resonancia, tiene un cáncer de mama mucho mayor que los dos centímetros que le indicaron.', 'Y la idea de llevarla directamente al quirófano con un cáncer de mama de ese tamaño, potencialmente positivo para ganglios, positivo para HER2 y negativo para los receptores hormonales no es realmente la forma en que actuaríamos nosotros, ciertamente no es multidisciplinaria, pero tampoco es necesariamente la forma ideal en que actuaríamos ahora porque después de ver a la paciente y comentarlo en la trastienda, recomendamos un abordaje preoperatorio.', 'Quería preservar la mama, si era posible, y se optó por el abordaje preoperatorio o terapia sistémica neoadyuvante porque, está recomendada, porque su tumor es grande, y HER-2 positivo y RE/RP negativo.', 'Sabemos que va a recibir terapia sistémica.', 'Va a recibir quimioterapia con terapia anti-HER2, porque ese es el enfoque estándar.', 'Y quisiéramos administrarlo como tratamiento neoadyuvante para reducir el tumor y posiblemente permitirle conservar el seno.', 'Otras ventajas son que, en la actualidad, en el contexto del cáncer de mama HER2+, así como con el cáncer de mama triple negativo ahora, la respuesta que una persona podría tener a la terapia preoperatoria puede de hecho orientar las terapias posteriores.', 'No voy a entrar en detalles, pero ciertamente, se está convirtiendo en un nuevo estándar de atención en pacientes con cáncer de mama HER2+ según los datos recientes y que están surgiendo.', 'Entonces, al administrarle un tratamiento podría quedar claro que necesita un segundo tratamiento, o podría quedar claro que no necesita el segundo tratamiento después de su terapia preoperatoria.', 'Por último, otros beneficios de la terapia neoadyuvante en esta situación concreta es que le podría dar tiempo para hacerse las pruebas genéticas, ver la cirugía plástica, si terminara necesitando una mastectomía, para considerar opciones óptimas de reconstrucción, si fuera necesario.', 'Y, al final, saben, terminamos ofreciéndole un ensayo clínico.', 'Por lo tanto, nuestro estándar actual para la terapia anti-HER2 preoperatoria es utilizar THP, como lo es para muchos, especialmente en el mundo desarrollado, donde estos fármacos están disponibles.', 'Son Taxol, Herceptin y pertuzumab.', 'Y tenemos un estudio que está probando Taxol, margetuximab y pertuzumab.', 'Por eso la apoyamos para que participe en ese ensayo.', 'Y pareció una buena opción, así que ella está planeando participar.', 'Por todas esas razones, tanto el enfoque multidisciplinario, como el plan de administrar terapia neoadyuvante en esta paciente concreta era lo correcto desde el punto de vista oncológico.', 'Y creo que sin el enfoque multidisciplinario, y especialmente en un lugar en el que siempre lo hacemos, por lo que sabemos que eso es lo que hay que hacer desde el punto de vista oncológico, estábamos felices por esta mujer, que vino para una segunda opinión, y que de hecho transfirió a nosotros su atención, aunque vive bastante lejos.', 'También la derivamos a trabajo social, porque tiene hijos, y queríamos consultar con ellos acerca de cómo hablar mejor con sus hijos y apoyar a su pareja.', 'La derivamos a nuestros colegas de enfermería, porque va a recibir quimioterapia, eso la haría perder el pelo, el taxano.', 'Y así, la vamos a preparar para la técnica de enfriamiento del cuero cabelludo.', 'Y también fue inscrita en nuestro programa auxiliar especializado para mujeres jóvenes.', 'Así, es un enfoque multidisciplinario real, que creemos que mejora cómo se sienten las mujeres a lo largo de su tratamiento, la confianza que tienen en su atención médica y sus decisiones, así como, a la larga, posiblemente sus resultados, en especial cuando afecta a las decisiones terapéuticas y la eficacia del tratamiento, en última instancia.', 'Esta paciente tampoco quería tener más hijos, de lo contrario habría considerado la derivación a endocrinología reproductiva.', 'Y, por último, la atención multidisciplinaria y la toma de decisiones permiten que esto suceda de manera oportuna.', 'De este modo, cuando se tiene una clínica multidisciplinaria, se puede hacer todo esto junto muy rápidamente y todo el mundo está listo.', 'Eso no quiere decir que sea fácil, o que no haya obstáculos que saltar, y problemas logísticos tanto para las pacientes como para los profesionales sanitarios, pero cuando uno está acostumbrado a hacerlo, y, ya sabemos, hay algunas dificultades de encaje al principio, seguro, veremos que podemos hacerlo realidad.', 'Y esa paciente acaba de venir y acudió a verme la semana pasada, obtuvo imágenes diagnósticas adicionales, y se sometió la aspiración con aguja fina en los últimos días, y la vamos a preparar para el estudio en la próxima semana.', 'Así que, va a comenzar pronto.', 'Muy bien.', '¿Y qué nos dijo la paciente y por qué cambia su atención médica para venirse con nosotros?', 'Bueno, sintió que la tranquilizaba que su equipo de oncología médica y de oncología quirúrgica recomendaran el mismo enfoque y que estuvieran de acuerdo en que tendría que ver a un radiooncólogo si conservaba la mama, o dependiendo de su respuesta a la terapia y la afectación ganglionar.', 'También apreciaba la comodidad y el enfoque oportuno de la atención médica, ya que quería recibir tratamiento y el tratamiento comenzó lo antes posible.', 'Y no se sentía cómoda con la idea de entrar incluso directamente en quirófano cuando visitó al cirujano inicialmente.', 'Así que, es una situación beneficiosa parar todos, para la atención multidisciplinaria y para la paciente, en última instancia.', 'Así pues, concluiré aquí.', 'Y como mencioné, hay varios ejemplos de por qué es importante la atención multidisciplinaria.', 'Yo también diría, como profesional sanitario, que atender pacientes con cáncer de mama es un desafío para las pacientes, a veces puede afectar emocionalmente, y tener colegas con los que se comparte una paciente y se les brinda apoyo juntos, hace que sea mucho más, supongo, motivador, y no tan difícil tanto para la paciente como para los profesionales, porque todos compartimos el cuidado de la paciente.', 'Compartimos los buenos tiempos.', 'Compartimos los malos tiempos.', 'Otra paciente recientemente tuvo una RPC, respuesta patológica completa al tratamiento preoperatorio en nuestra consulta.', 'Y nos enteramos por patología, y los correos electrónicos eran: \"¡Sí!\"', 'Y llegamos a, «venga, ¿quién llama a la paciente y le cuenta las buenas noticias?»', 'Y, por supuesto, cuando lidiamos con noticias difíciles, también ayuda tener el apoyo de los colegas.', 'Así que soy una gran fan de la atención multidisciplinaria.', 'Y estoy segura de que tendrán un montón de preguntas y cosas que comentar en el turno de preguntas.. Muchas gracias.']\n",

Barge, del Centro de Cáncer MD Anderson de la Universidad de Texas en Houston, Texas, Estados Unidos.', 'Ahora le entregaremos la palabra a la profesora Barj.', 'Profesor, su línea está ahora abierta.', 'Hola a todos,', \"This is Charles Balch from Houston, Texas, and I'm pleased to join this webinar to talk about the impact of oncologic surgical outcomes. And I'm also involved in this is my good friend, Professor Ricardo Adisicio, the past president of the British Society of Surgical Oncology and the president-elect of the European Society of Surgical Oncology, and he will lead a question and answer period at the end of my presentation.\", \"So I'll go briefly through my slides, but I'm hoping that you will download at a future time several papers that I think are seminal papers involving surgeons around the world. And these come from the Lancet Commission that were published in 2015 in Lancet Oncology.\", \"The first of which was about global surgery in the year 2030. And I'll just give a few quotes from these papers.\", 'The first is access to surgical care is essential for reduction of mortality and morbidity from surgical conditions. However, and this is really an important fact and a startling one, more than two billion people have no access to surgery and anesthesia. And, moreover, this figure is probably an underestimate.', 'so universal access to safe affordable surgical care is essential', 'In a subsequent paper that Dr. Adisio and I were involved in in Lancet Oncology, focused on global cancer surgery and how to deliver safe, affordable and timely cancer surgery. And I would really commend this paper for all of you who are listening to read.', 'Así que este artículo fue publicado en Lancet Oncology en 2015. Y, como se puede ver de los flechas, Dr. Odishio y yo fuimos coautores de este. Y parte del resumen, que destacaré brevemente, indicó que para el año 2013, es decir, solo 13 años después, estimamos que se necesitarán 45 millones de procedimientos quirúrgicos en todo el mundo. Y, sin embargo, menos del 25% de los pacientes con cáncer en todo el mundo reciben cirugía segura, asequible y oportuna.', \"So there's much work to be done here. And just a few more quotes from this paper in Lancet Oncology that issues of access to surgery, a paucity of investment in public surgical systems, low investment in research and training in surgery, and educational gaps are remarkably widespread globally.\", \"And we offered up solutions that include a better regulated public system, especially in the training and certification of surgeons, international partnerships, super centralization of surgical services, and I'll come back to that later, novel surgical clinical trials, and new approaches to improve quality and scale up of cancer surgical systems through education and training.\", \"and i'll give some examples of that later in this lecture\", 'So going on with a few more summary statements from this important paper, achieving good outcomes in modern cancer surgery is technically demanding, and it is recognized that outcomes improve when such surgery is undertaken by specialized teams in high-volume centers.', \"And I'll go into this important strategy in more detail, but with the emphasis that we're talking about the more complicated patients, the more complicated operations, and in high-volume centers.\", \"But I think what's important as a summary is that access to high-quality training in these units with suitable accreditation and quality control for aspiring oncologic surgeons has yet to be formally met by regulatory authorities in actually quite a number of countries.\", 'And although high-income countries, such as many countries in Europe and in the United States, are driving greater specialization, globally, there is a need for surgeons with much wider training. The surgical professional societies must play an enhanced role in this area. And finally, that high-income and middle-income countries have a duty and an opportunity to expand their educational offerings on cancer surgery to low-income countries through bilateral exchanges, a greater use of technology-enhanced learning, and partnerships to develop specific curriculum content on cancer into general surgery residency training programs.', \"These are some examples of the partnerships and availability of global programs in education, including the Society of Surgical Oncology, the European Society, the British Association, and several other organizations such as ESMO, ASCO, and a group that I'm involved in called Health Volunteers Overseas that's based in the United States.\", 'Ahora, en estas próximas diapositivas, quiero enfatizar la importancia y el valor en términos de atención de calidad en especialización.', 'There has been a rapid and substantial advances in cancer research with new diagnostics and biomarkers, new systemic therapies including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy and more recently, immunotherapy.', 'and this has led to new combinations and sequences of cancer treatments including neo-adjuvant and adjuvant therapies in the surgical patients', 'So all of us in surgery has to keep up with these rapidly advancing fields.', 'There are major advances in surgical technologies in the operating room as well, such as laparoscopic surgery, robotic surgery, and intraoperative imaging techniques. And the question is then, how can we excise cancer with better and safer results, with lower incidence of complications, and better local regional control, and the importance in addition of rehabilitation and restoring function to patients after surgery.', 'And there are many changes now in the delivery of cancer care through the regional concept of cancer centers, a multidisciplinary team of oncologic specialists, which have to include surgeons who choose to spend part of their time as part of a multidisciplinary team and participating in treatment planning with our colleagues in medical, radiation, oncology, pathology, and radiology.', \"and i'll show just a few slides of evidence that high-volume cancer centers and surgical specialists have better outcomes for treating complex cancers\", 'Y como voy a mencionar de nuevo, al final de esto, esto no significa para las operaciones rutinarias y los pacientes rutinarios que necesitan especializarse, porque necesitamos cirujanos generales que practiquen cirugía de alta calidad y segura, pero tiene el juicio de saber cuándo algunos pacientes deben ser transferidos a un centro regional donde podrían obtener mejores resultados.', 'Y para mostrarles un ejemplo de una enfermedad común, esta fue una publicación en el British Journal of Cancer en 2004, en la que citaré que las pacientes con cáncer de mama tratadas por especialistas, en comparación con unidades no especialistas, tenían la mitad de riesgo de tratamiento inadecuado de la mama y un riesgo cinco veces menor de cirugía axilar inadecuada y un riesgo nueve veces menor de tratamiento axilar inadecuado. Y que en realidad, las tasas de recurrencia local, que es una métrica de los resultados quirúrgicos, fue 57% más baja a los ocho años, y el riesgo de muerte por cáncer de mama era 20% menor para las mujeres tratadas en unidades especialistas.', 'and that we conclude that adequate surgical management of breast centers is fundamental to improving the outcome for breast cancer irrespective of where it is delivered', 'Now, remember, this was published in 2004, and since then, the British healthcare system has really developed much greater cancer centers and regionalization of breast cancer, which perhaps Professor Adesso may want to comment on.', 'Pero aquí en los Estados Unidos, también había un número de artículos en ese momento que mostraban que el volumen quirúrgico impacta la supervivencia. Si los cirujanos realizan al menos 15 o más operaciones de cáncer de mama por año, y que con la especialización quirúrgica, aquellos entrenados en cirugía de mama, oncología o oncología quirúrgica, había una reducción del 36% en el riesgo de muerte a los cinco años, incluso después de ajustar por el volumen del hospital, el volumen quirúrgico, la edad, el estadio y la raza del paciente.', \"And here are just a few examples that I selected from the New England Journal of Medicine classic studies showing the relationship between hospital volume and surgical mortality in the United States. And the teaching point here is for colectomy, a more standard operation, there wasn't a difference comparing hospital volume and adjusted mortality. However, there was a significant difference in treatment-related mortality after surgery for gastrectomy, esophagectomy, and pancreatic resection.\", \"And going on in another paper looking at surgeon volume, the last paper was on hospital volume, surgeon volume and operative mortality. Again, there were some operations such as we're looking at adjusted operative mortality. There was not much different in resection for lung cancer or for cystectomy, but there was a highly significant difference comparing surgeon volume and operative mortality for esophagectomy and pancreas resection.\", 'Now, this is an interlude slide just to remind you that your views are important. You can ask questions and send comments by clicking on the Q&A button and sending in your questions. So at the end of this lecture, Professor Adesso and I can lead a discussion with your questions.', \"But getting back to my lecture, I wanted to point out that volume, be it hospital or surgeon volume, isn't always the most important thing, that patient risk factors are important as well. And I've shown some photos, either from my travels in Africa or even from my own personal experience of patients who have neglected their tumors or they've had inadequate treatment at the beginning and suffer at the end with extensive regional metastasis that might have been controlled had surgery been more complete or done at an earlier time in the course of the patient's disease.\", 'so this is just illustrating that patient stage presentation and comorbidity of patients especially among older patients will also make a difference in outcome', 'So in summary from some of these papers from the New England Journal of Medicine and other publications, if one is comparing the post-operative mortality in specialized centers comparing community hospitals in the United States, there was no difference for a variety of tumors involving breast, melanoma, ovarian, prostate, thyroid, and uterus.', 'Sin embargo, hubo diferencias entre pacientes de alto riesgo comparando los centros especializados con los hospitales comunitarios, mostrando que para los pacientes de mayor riesgo y alto riesgo, hubo una diferencia significativa en especializaciones. Mientras que en pacientes de bajo riesgo, no hubo diferencia entre los centros especializados y los hospitales comunitarios.', \"And finally, there was a difference for all patients for these two areas, pancreas and esophagus, comparing postoperative mortality, showing that regardless of the patient's risk factors, that those patients treated in specialized centers had a significant reduction in postoperative mortality for these two conditions.\", 'And here is just one other paper from Dr. Birkmyre in the New England Journal of Medicine, again showing hospital mortality and both based on surgeon volume and hospital volume, showing highly significant differences of relating volume and outcome with regard to 30-day surgically related mortality.', 'Ahora, la American College of Surgeons ha lanzado un programa de mejora de la calidad quirúrgica nacional, para el cual la mayoría de los hospitales en los Estados Unidos participan en estos programas de NCQP. Y esto solo muestra que cuando se inicia un programa a nivel nacional, y en este caso, por la American College of Surgeons, que el 66% de los hospitales, ahora en los Estados Unidos, incluyendo hospitales comunitarios, que el 66% de ellos mejoraron su mortalidad, el 82% mejoraron su morbabilidad, los que mejoraron menos, es decir, los cirujanos de bajo volumen o los hospitales de bajo volumen, eran más propensos a mejorar, pero incluso los que mejoraron bien también mejoraron.', 'and that the number of low outliers increased and the number of high outliers decreased, which is good based upon the quality programs initiated at a national level.', 'And because of this program, each hospital was estimated to avoid 250 complications per year in each hospital on average.', \"So again, I want you to send in your questions by clicking on the Q&A budget, and then we'll resume in another area about the training of oncologic surgeons.\", 'And here is a very important point, that although we talk about surgical oncology and the super specialization, the American Board of Surgery, which certifies all general surgeons and general surgery-based specialties, includes surgical oncology, including head and neck surgery, among its core areas that are included in its board exams.', 'so surgical oncology and the understanding about the role of surgery in cancer management is equally important to trauma burns vascular pediatrics critical care and other criteria', 'And going beyond that are two organizations, the Society of Surgical Oncology and the European Society of Surgical Oncology, led by Dr. Chandra R here in the United States, but also including Professor DCO representing the ESSO, that published two important papers, the first showing very large variations in the training of surgical oncologists around the world, and then jointly proposing a global curriculum in surgical oncology that can be used both for training general surgeons, but also as curriculum recommendations for training surgical oncology specialists, who are very important at the national level for managing the very complex patients and for leading the training programs of general surgeons.', 'And our curriculum features both in the United States and in these global curriculum included the distinguishing features of surgical oncologists who manage complex operations, who are part of a multidisciplinary team that involve medical and radiation oncology in treatment planning for patients at the outset of their diagnosis and participate as an oncologist in long-term disease management of the cancer patient.', 'And this recently, the American Board of Surgery has approved a new certificate in complex general surgical oncology, acknowledging that there is a sufficient amount of specialized material that justifies a separate sub-board in complex general surgical oncology.', 'now in a formal level and this comes along the board certifications in medical oncology pediatric oncology and radiation oncology there is now a separate board in complex general surgical oncology', 'And this two-year training involves additional training in multidisciplinary cancer care, surgical management of oncologic conditions, patient counseling on cancer prevention and intervention, and very importantly, the participation and leadership in clinical research and clinical trial design.', 'And this includes such things that actually all general surgeons managing breast cancer, for example, and especially those surgical oncologists who specialize in breast cancer, need to know how to use ultrasound and core needle biopsy.', \"and i say this because in my travels to other countries there are still many community-based centers we're doing an open biopsy as to make the diagnosis of breast cancer is the standard of care\", 'Whereas in the specialty hospitals and in many centers in Europe and the United States, even at the community level, the standard of care is to use a core needle biopsy instead of an open biopsy as the preferred treatment for patients with a first diagnosis of breast cancer.', 'Now, in these next few slides, I want to emphasize what is a very important part of the surgical patients here in breast cancer, in patients who present with stage 3 disease, that with contemporary chemotherapy and systemic and targeted therapy, patients are now achieving a pathological complete response in 40 to 60 percent of such patients. And this is going to change how we manage patients surgically, because surgery may not be the first modality of treatment.', 'En el cáncer de mama en los Estados Unidos, la mayoría de los pacientes con cáncer de mama en etapa 2 y etapa 3. Y creo que en muchos centros en Europa, especialmente para la enfermedad en etapa 3, la terapia sistémica es el primer tratamiento, y luego la cirugía es el segundo tratamiento. Así que hay muchos diferentes planes que tenemos que hacer con nuestros colegas en oncología médica sobre el momento de la cirugía, el papel del nódulo sentinela, que es diferente en este contexto. Pero esto representa el futuro de nuestros tratamientos para muchas enfermedades, para las que el cáncer de mama es el prototipo que cambiará.', \"But here's another example. Here is a patient with bulky and unresectable advanced melanoma in the groin and pelvis, who was treated with immunotherapy, and after immunotherapy, had such a shrinkage that it facilitated the operation. And in fact, in this patient, when all these masses were removed, they were all containing chronic inflammation and scar. This patient had a pathological complete response, which could not have been staged without surgical resection of the tumor masses that originally were detected.\", 'So the future of cancer systemic therapy is changing dramatically. There are more effective therapies and in fact many of the new therapies are going to be oral therapies that are much less toxicity and will impact the surgical patients.', 'here is just an example of where new oral or subcutaneous agents are available for a variety of cancer types', 'just to give you some examples these are the more dramatic examples but they are getting to be more typical', 'Este es un paciente que tenía un melanoma metastásico extenso que, incluso después de dos semanas de terapia, se podía ver en el escáner PET-CT. Se ve una reducción dramática en este tumor extenso.', 'and these agents are so powerful they are already beginning to be applied in stage three melanoma patients', 'The other major advance that is happening is the use of immunotherapy with the new checkpoint inhibitors, which now have activity in over 17 different types of cancer. And this does represent our future that will be used increasingly in surgical patients.', 'But just to give you a few individual examples so that you have some idea about the future of therapy, here is an example of a very large melanoma metastasis that after a single dose of combination immunotherapy, this patient had a pathological complete response demonstrated by surgical excision of the remaining tissue.', 'and here is maybe a more famous example our u s president jimmy carter and this is in the public arena presented with liver and brain metastases and at age ninety two was treated for a short interval with a single dose of a anti pd one checkpoint inhibitor', 'He has now been disease-free and in complete remission for over 14 months with this single agent in a patient who is much older and who tolerated this treatment.', 'Quería mostrar, de nuevo, un ejemplo de un paciente con cáncer de cabeza y cuello que tenía 96 años, enfermedad extensa. E incluso después de cuatro semanas con este anti-pd1, una sola terapia tuvo una respuesta dramática.', \"so if we're seeing these kind of treatment responses in patients with more advanced disease you can be sure that this will migrate into the treatment of patients with earlier disease such as stage two and stage three cancers\", 'So how are we as practicing surgeons going to keep up with these rapidly advancing fields, both fields in systemic therapy, radiation therapy, and also technological advances in the operating room and new advances in biomarkers used to select patients for these different treatments?', 'And here again, there are a whole variety of ways that this is happening with live meetings, especially those conducted by the SSO and the ESSO and BASO, but also through affiliations with tertiary centers, such as in my institution, with community hospitals, with advances in journals, with email collaborations, or with live webinars, such as this webinar that is being conducted by the European Institute of Oncology.', 'Both Dr. Adesso and I are the editors-in-chief of our two respective journals, and we would commend those to you for keeping up with the field, both the online version and the print version.', 'the society of surgical oncology also now has a self-assessment program that is conducted to help surgeons keep up with the field in oncology', \"And increasingly, we're using telemedicine in the United States that is increasingly being integrated into the ongoing operations of hospitals, specialty departments, home health agencies, private physician offices, and in some cases, even for educational purposes in the consumer's home.\", 'So telemedicine is increasingly being used not only in the United States, but around the world, both for medical education to physicians, especially those in the community setting and those in more rural areas, and also for specialist consultative services, especially in helping in patient care decision making in other locations or even in other nations.', 'The technology allows us now to, with high resolution, to view images of x-rays, images of pathology, and even to look at ultrasound images real time that are being conducted in another site and transmitted electronically to a central site by telemedicine.', \"I've even been involved in a company called Cancer Expert Now. I'm the president of Cancer Expert Now International, where we do consultation with physicians.\", 'This shows an example by telemedicine of one of our neuro-oncologists doing a consultation with a physician in another country on a complicated patient with a brain tumor.', 'And this shows just another example where I was in Hong Kong, China, and we conducted a telemedicine virtual tumor board here with Dr. Hope Rugo, who was in San Francisco at the time, discussing a complicated patient with breast cancer.', 'Y aquí está, justo después de esto, un televideo en el mismo lugar, en un paciente complejo de cáncer de colon con el Dr. Glenn Bolch, que es el jefe de cirugía de colon y recto en Emory en Atlanta.', 'Again, just showing the illustrations about how virtual tumor boards can be used to help in the advice and recommendations for patients with complex cancer now anywhere in the world.', 'Y yo acabo de incluir esta diapositiva para un resumen que se presentó el año pasado en ASCO, mostrando que el 91% de los asistentes a la mesa redonda virtual lo encontraron muy útil, y el 100% de los asistentes sintieron que la calidad de la atención mejoró.', \"alright and then again we're almost finishing our talk i'm going to do the summary shortly\", 'And just as a reminder to do your Q&A buttons as I summarize.', 'so how do we as surgeons adapt to a change in a rapidly changing cancer patients', 'It is clear in the United States, and I think in many parts of Europe and elsewhere in the world, that many cancer patients will receive more than one modality of treatment, and that contemporary cancer care is a team approach, combining the collective wisdom of surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and oftentimes with their pathology and radiation oncology.', 'it is clear with the advances in effective systemic therapy that cancer is becoming a chronic or curable disease', 'El cáncer de mama es un muy buen ejemplo de eso.', 'And after all of these intensive treatments, survivorships in patients who are living for years after their treatment are at risk for second primaries treatment compliance and the consequences of their intensive multidisciplinary treatment.', 'The oncology field is one of the most rapidly advancing and changing specialties in all of medicine, and that means that we as surgeons have to keep up through continuing education and incorporate these changes into the curriculum of our trainees.', \"And it's also important to validate these advances in surgical patients systematically through clinical trials.\", \"And as I've tried to emphasize, there is a continuing partnerships of professional organizations, especially in the United States and Europe, on physician continuing education that has to occur for a lifetime and in improving the curriculum of general surgeons and general surgery-based specialties in all institutions throughout the world.\", 'Surgeons, in order to achieve a better outcome, are going to need to partition their patients and identify those for which specialization or referral to high volume centers specializing in certain diseases will have a better outcome for treating patients with complex or advanced cancers.', \"and there's both a public and even a government demand for getting optimal care from specialists multidisciplinary cancer centers and regionalization of cancer therapy\", 'Sin embargo, es importante enfatizar que esto no significa que todos los pacientes con cáncer necesiten ser tratados por especialistas, especialmente si se hace un diagnóstico temprano y el tratamiento es estándar y no necesita múltiples especialidades para su atención.', 'We really believe that patients should stay in their local environment as much as possible. And this is where things like telemedicine may have a role in helping ensure that patients, even in a smaller community hospital, are getting advice and treatment planning with input from specialists through telemedicine or consultation.', 'and that those of us who specialize as surgical oncologists should be educational and research leaders among the general surgery community.', 'Ahora estoy casi terminado con mi charla en resumen, que las sociedades profesionales como la sociedad que represento, la Sociedad de Oncología Quirúrgica, y anteriormente yo era CEO de ASCO, la Sociedad Europea de Oncología Quirúrgica, la Sociedad Americana de Cirujanos, ASCO, son ejemplos de organizaciones que pueden ser componentes importantes de definir los estándares para tratar a pacientes quirúrgicos con cáncer y proporcionar educación, capacitación, talleres para ayudar a otros cirujanos a lograr el mejor cuidado del cáncer.', 'and that the partnerships across our professional societies, which is well developed between the Europeans and American SSO organizations, will advance our specialty and improve the care for our patients.', \"So that is my conclusion. We'll now turn this over to Professor Adesso for his comments and to answer any questions that you may have made during this discussion.\", 'Muchas gracias.', 'Thank you, Charles. We have no words to be grateful to Professor Balshe for summarizing the present and the future of good quality cancer surgery worldwide.', 'And I really mean worldwide, because this is not just a sophisticated, super advanced surgical procedure that you might expect from an advanced tertiary referral center. This is a philosophy, this is a very basic attitude that we should all embrace. Even in a district general hospital, there is room and there is need for some kind of surgeons who is aware of the multi-disciplinary of the oncological practice, and he was keen to talk to different specialties and offer his own, his her own patients the most appropriate treatment.', \"So am I right to say, Professor Bals, that the bring home message is that good quality cancer surgery is expected, is demanded, and it's a worldwide need, not just from top cancer units, but from most, from actually all district hospitals as well.\", \"That's absolutely true, and I think the professional organizations and governments in each nation need to insist that their citizens get high quality care and ensure in each nation that there are well trained surgeons, that there are organizational systems such as regional cancer centers. And I think increasingly that there are relationships internationally with individuals or with organizations, medical centers and cancer centers that can be of assistance for consultation and complex patients, and in education of the surgeons in the local communities and even in the more provincial or national cancer centers and hospitals.\", \"For example, next week that I'm doing a multidisciplinary tumor board with a provincial hospital in China. And part of our theme is going to be how we can increase our use of tele-video in order to increase access for the doctors in China with experts to help in the intellectual decision-making for complex cancer patients.\", 'I think this is a very hot topic and perhaps we want to spend a little bit more time on how best to facilitate this.', 'You have just pointed out how the network is there and I would encourage young surgeons in training to feel absolutely free to follow their dreams, study their topics and when they meet the big professor at the meeting, pull the sleeve and contact a specialist, the top specialist and feel free to communicate with them, perhaps engage with them in the discussion and feel comfortable enough to take advantage of the large network that is available through the American Society of Surgical Oncology and the European one as well. We are at the moment working on facilitating this for developing countries in Africa through the unrestricted grant that pharmaceutical companies are making available. This is in my mind the way forward.', 'So I encourage you, um, guys, to, um, um, come and talk to, uh, Professor Bals, to myself and to whoever you want to improve your, uh, knowledge.', \"I think the important point is we can't mandate these changes. The initiative has to come from the surgeon in each community, from their hospital and from their government, both their local government and their national government, to raise the level of expectations for high quality and timely care.\", 'And then work in each nation within the limitations of their resources in order to achieve that over time.', \"Shall we also say a word in warning, some easy bite on super advanced technicalities, i.e. you don't want a PET scan when you don't have a ultrasound machine.\", 'You might consider not purchasing a robotic equipment when you are missing basic laparoscopic stuff. And therefore you need to develop the system, as you were saying, step by step according to the local facilities at the regional, provincial level.', \"Yes, that's absolutely true. I've been in one major hospital in Africa, which has a very expensive radiation therapy machine that is still in boxes because they don't have the radiation physicist or the radiation technicians or the service component. But they have the machine in a box that somebody bought, but it's more than that.\", 'So it takes planning at the government level and at the hospital level to make sure to define not just the capital expenditures of buildings and equipment, but the delivery of the services by qualified and trained individuals at all levels.', \"So, Professor Baggio, we always have enemies and allies when we want to achieve a target. And that's a bit of a silly and restrictive way to look at it, but it has been the case that most surgical oncologists would blame the general surgeons for not embracing an oncological attitude or philosophy. And on the other hand, some medical oncologists are wiping surgeons' skills under the carpet.\", 'Y estamos de acuerdo en decir que en realidad necesitamos a todos y damos la bienvenida a todos a bordo, porque esta es una discusión en curso, que es un placer crear juntos a medida que se desarrolla.', 'i agree and i think the point here is that the surgeon has to be involved in the treatment planning', \"As you and I have talked about, there are other specialties in surgeons who spend all their time in the operating room and allow the internal medicine trained person to get at the front and make all the decisions. And now in that specialty, and I'm talking about cardiac surgery, the surgeon is the court of last resort after all medical treatments have failed.\", \"And my concern that if the surgeon doesn't bring the surgical perspective to the treatment planning and is engaged with the medical oncologist and radiation oncologist, the patients may not get the full advantage of a true multidisciplinary treatment approach that does involve surgery. But we are best trained and have the experience to determine what's the best timing of surgery in some combination and sequence.\", 'Si no estamos en la mesa, seremos el tribunal de último recurso después de que todo lo demás falla con el tratamiento médico y el tratamiento con radiación.', 'So we have to be engaged in the treatment planning at the outset.', \"Yeah, good. So once again, we totally embrace a multidisciplinary attitude where more and more perhaps new figures are taking part. For example, I'm thinking of interventional radiologists that only maybe a decade or two decades ago were almost unknown, but nowadays they stent, they put catheters, they deliver medication and isotopes. And so, once again, let's reiterate the point that we want everyone on board here.\", \"I'm taking advantage of this time because I understand from the organizer that there is a problem with the questions coming in and this has not been made available today. There is a technical hiccup.\", \"So we do apologize for this. And let's make sure that if you have any question, you definitely can come back. The audience can definitely come back to me and Professor Balschi in writing, and we will be pleased to provide any answer or satisfy any request.\", 'Pero estoy muy contento de ser parte de esta importante sesión y de unirme a usted, un cirujano oncólogo internacionalmente reconocido, en este foro educativo por televideo.', 'Estoy muy agradecido con la Escuela Europea de Oncología porque a menudo sentimos que el equipo quirúrgico se está un poco descuidando. Así que me gustaría felicitar a Aizo por esto y tal vez, ya sabes, apretar su brazo y asegurarme de que se dé más espacio y más interés en lo que los cirujanos están haciendo.', '¿Hay alguna nota concluyente que le gustaría subrayar, profesor Balz?', \"yes i'd like you to get the last word i purposely planted these slides about breast cancer management in great britain a high income place\", \"and it's my understanding that subsequent to that time around the year two thousand to two thousand and four the british government really did engage in cancer center and regionalization and that the care in breast cancer is greatly improved\", \"You live in that arena and you've witnessed that and I wonder if you would just comment because one of our themes is there is a need for some level of specialization even in breast cancer.\", 'Okay, I am going to share my thoughts with you and the participants.', \"I'm sure that I hope that I'm not offending anybody, but the story goes that when I first came to this country in 99 breast surgery was dealt with by the most clumsy surgeons. They were perhaps not very skilled for visceral surgery, so they were relegated to subcutaneous cancer surgery.\", 'And therefore, the, um, cosmetic outcomes when outcomes were unbelievable, and the, uh, oncological, uh, results were also very, very poor.', 'Y en esos días, todavía sufríamos de los egos que, ya sabes, los cirujanos pueden hacer todo, o no necesitas, te he curado, no necesitas ningún quimioterapia, no necesitas ningún radio. Simplemente vuelves a mí en seis meses, en un año, y estás curado.', 'Now, fortunately, there has been a desire, a decision to establish dedicated breast surgeons.', 'The old guys have retired and now there are more and more young people who are really focusing on breast only.', 'And this means that they are not doing the on-call in the night, they are simply focusing on breast cancer surgery.', \"And also, Professor Adagio, isn't it true that there's been an establishment of cancer centers on a regional basis that, not only for breast, but for other diseases, has elevated the quality of care?\", \"Yes, definitely so. This is particularly true for advanced cancer surgery, as you pointed out, liver surgery, pancreatic surgery, sarcomas, peritoneal disease. There is no point in having 20 units across the country. We have four accredited, fully audited and nicely scrutinized and beautifully performing units, so that's the setting.\", 'The point I was making is that I think that the young generation has now embraced, as you were saying before, the idea of working together and deciding, yes, surgical issues, but at what time, in which patients, how aggressive should we be?', 'And what is left after surgery?', 'And we are definitely improving on these, and the results are there. The cancer outcomes have improved.', \"I'm not sure that I can quote it due to the establishment of the multidisciplinary team, but it's definitely true that this cohesive philosophy, this harmonic approach to the cancer patient has definitely improved the outcomes.\", 'Yeah, and I think the teaching point, the summary of all of this talk is that surgeons have to play a role in this rapidly advancing field, and that tragically, billions of people are not getting access to safe, affordable and timely care.', 'and i think all of us need to redouble our efforts to help cancer patients throughout the world so that regardless of where they live they can gain access either by a more educated and trained local physician or referral to a regional center', 'And that the education process is enhanced in every country so that we can all keep up with this rapidly growing field and be able to safely introduce these new therapies as they are approved by governments and insurance schemes.', 'I am very grateful, Professor Bach, for your time, for your wise vision and for sharing your thoughts with us.', 'Grazie mille, grazie, ciao ciao, arrivederci, grazie.

Balch of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer center, Houston, Texas, USA.', 'We will now hand over to Professor Balch.', 'Professor, your line is now open.', 'Hello everyone.', \"This is Charles Balch from Houston, Texas and I'm pleased to join this webinar to talk about the impact of oncologic surgical outcomes and I'm also involved in this is my good friend Professor Riccardo Audisio, the past president of the British Society of Surgical Oncology and the president elect of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and he will lead a question and answer period at the end of my presentation.\", \"So I'll go briefly through my slides but I'm hoping that you will download at a future time several papers that I think are seminal papers involving surgeons around the world, and these come from the Lancet Commission that were published in 2015 in Lancet Oncology.\", \"The first of which was about global surgery in the year 2030 and I'll just give a few quotes from these papers.\", 'The first is access to surgical care is essential for reduction of mortality and morbidity from surgical conditions, however and this is really an important fact and a startling one. More than two billion people have no access to surgery and anesthesia and moreover this figure is probably an underestimate.', 'So universal access to safe, affordable, surgical care is essential.', 'In a subsequent paper that Dr Audisio and I were involved in, in Lancet Oncology focused on global cancer surgery and how to deliver safe, affordable and timely cancer surgery and I would really commend this paper for all of you who are listening to read.', \"So this paper was published in Lancet Oncology in 2015 and as you can see from the arrows after Audisio and I were both co-authors of this and part of the summary which I will highlight very briefly stated that by the year 2030, that's just thirteen years from now, we estimate that forty five million surgical procedures will be needed worldwide and yet less than twenty five percent of cancer patients worldwide actually get safe affordable or timely surgery.\", \"So there's much work to be done here and just a few more quotes from this paper in Lancet Oncology that issues of access to surgery, a paucity of investment in public surgical systems, low investment in research, in training, in surgery and educational gaps are remarkably widespread globally.\", \"And we offered up solutions that include, a better regulated public system especially in the training and certification of surgeons, international partnerships, super centralization of surgical services and I'll come back to that later, novel surgical clinical trials, and new approaches to improve quality and scale-up of cancer surgical systems through education and training.\", \"And I'll give some examples of that later in this lecture.\", 'So going on with a few more summary statements from this important paper, achieving good outcomes in modern cancer surgery is technically demanding and it is recognized that outcomes improve when such surgery is undertaken by specialized teams in high volume centres.', \"And I'll go into this important strategy in more detail but with the emphasis that we're talking about the more complicated patients, the more complicated operations, and in high volume centers.\", \"But I think what's important as a summary is that access to high-quality training in these units with suitable accreditation and quality control for aspiring oncologic surgeons has yet to be formally met by regulatory authorities in actually quite a number of countries.\", 'And although high-income countries such as many countries in Europe and in the United States are driving greater specialization, globally there is a need for surgeons with much wider training the surgical professional societies must play an enhanced role in this area and finally, that high income and middle income countries have a duty and an opportunity to expand their educational offerings on cancer surgery to low income countries through bilateral exchanges, a greater use of technology enhanced learning, and partnerships to develop specific curriculum content on cancer into general surgery residency training programs.', \"These are some examples of the partnerships and availability of global programs in education including the Society of Surgical Oncology, the European Society, the British Association and several other organizations such as ESMO, ASCO, and a group that I'm involved in called Health Volunteers Overseas, that's based in the United States.\", 'In these next few slides I want to emphasize the importance and the value in terms of quality care on specialisation.', \"There's been a rapid and substantial advances in cancer research, with new diagnostics in biomarkers, new systemic therapies including chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy and more recently immunotherapy.\", 'And this has led to new combinations and sequences of cancer treatments including new adjuvant, and adjuvant therapies in the surgical patients.', 'So all of us in surgery has to keep up with these rapidly advancing fields.', 'There are major advances in surgical technologies in the operating room as well, such as, laparoscopic surgery, robotic surgery and intraoperative imaging techniques. And the question is then, how can we excise cancer with better and safer results, with lower incidence of complications, and better local regional control, and the importance in in addition of rehabilitation and restoring function to patients after surgery.', 'And there are many changes now in the delivery of cancer care through the regional concept of cancer centers, a multi-disciplinary team of oncologic specialists which have to include surgeons who choose to spend part of their time as part of a multi-disciplinary team and participating in treatment planning with our colleagues in medical radiation oncology, pathology and radiology.', \"And I'll show just a few slides of evidence that high volume cancer centers and surgical specialists have better outcomes for treating complex cancers.\", 'And as I mentioned again at the end of, this does not mean for the routine operations and routine patients that need to specialize because we do need general surgeons who practice high-quality and safe surgery but has the judgment to know when some patients should be passed on to a regional centre where they could get better results.', 'And just to show you an example for a common disease, this was a publication in the British Journal of Cancer in 2004, in which I quote that breast cancer patients treated in by specialists compared to non specialist unit had half the risk of inadequate treatment of the breast and a five fold lower risk of inadequate axillary surgery and a nine times lower risk of inex inadequate axillary treatment. and that actually local recurrence rates which is a metric of surgical outcome was fifty seven percent lower at eight years and the risk of death from breast cancer was twenty percent lower for women treated in specialist units.', 'And that we conclude that adequate surgical management of breast centers is fundamental to improving the outcome for breast cancer irrespective of where it is delivered.', 'Now remember this was published in 2004 and since then the British healthcare system has really developed much greater cancer centres and regionalisation of breast cancer which perhaps Professor Audisio may want to comment on.', 'But here in the United States there were also a number of papers at the time showing that surgical volume impacts survival if surgeons perform at least fifteen or more breast cancer operations per year and that with surgical specialisation those trained in breast surgery oncology or surgical oncology there was a thirty six percent reduction in the risk of death at five years even after adjusting for hospital volume, surgical volume, age, stage and race of the patient.', \"And here are just a few examples that I selected for the New England Journal of Medicine classic studies showing the relationship between hospital volume and surgical mortality in the United States and the teaching point here is for colectomy a more standard operation there wasn't a difference comparing hospital volume and adjusted mortality however, there was a significant difference in treatment related mortality after surgery for gastrectomy a suffragette to me and pancreatic resections.\", 'Going on in another paper looking at surgeon volume the last paper was on hospital volume. Surgeon volume and operative mortality, again there were some operations such as, were looking at adjusted operative mortality there was not much different in resection for lung cancer or for cystecomy, but there was a highly significant difference comparing surgeon volume and operative mortality for esophagectomy and pancreas resections.', 'Now this is an interlude slide just to remind you that your views are important, you can ask questions and send comments by clicking on the Q & A button and sending in your questions so at the end of this lecture Professor Audisio and I can lead a discussion with your questions.', \"Getting back to my lecture I wanted to point out that volume either hospital or surgeon volume, isn't always the most important thing, that patient risk factors are important as well and I've showed some photos either from my travels in Africa or even from my own personal experience of patients who have neglected their tumors or they've had inadequate treatment at the beginning and suffer at the end with extensive regional metastasis that might have been controlled had surgery been more complete or done at an earlier time in the course of the patient's disease.\", 'So this is just illustrating that patient stage presentation and comorbidity of patients, especially among older patients, will also make a difference in outcome.', 'So in summary from some of these papers from the New England Journal of Medicine and every publication in other publications, if one is comparing the post-operative mortality in specialized centers, comparing to community hospitals in the United States there was no difference for variety of tumors involving Breast, Melanoma, Ovarian, Prostate, Thyroid and Uterine.', 'However, there were differences among high risk patients comparing the specialized centers with community hospitals, showing that for the highest risk and high risk patients, there was a significant difference in specializations whereas in patients with low risk there was not a difference between the specialized centers and the community hospitals.', 'And finally, there was a difference for all patients, for these two areas pancreas and esophagus, comparing post-operative mortality. Showing that regardless of the patients risk factors that those patients treated in specialized centers had a significant reduction in post-operative mortality for these two conditions.', 'And here is just one other paper from Dr Birkmeyer in the New England Journal of Medicine, again showing hospital mortality and both based on surgeon volume and hospital volume, showing highly significant differences of relating volume and outcome with regard to thirty day surgically related mortality.', 'The American College of Surgeons has launched on a NSQIP program a national surgical quality improvement program, for which most of the hospitals now in the United States participate in these NSQIP programs and this just shows when a program was initiated at a national level and in this case by the American College of Surgeons, that sixty six percent of the hospitals, now these are almost all the hospitals in the United States, including community hospitals, that sixty six percent of them improve their mortality, eighty two percent improve their morbidity, the worst performing that is low volume surgeons or low volume hospitals, were more likely to improve but even good performers were improved as well.', 'And that the number of low outliers increased and the number of high outliers decrease which is good based upon these quality programs initiated at a national levels.', 'And because of this program, each hospital was estimated to avoid two hundred and fifty complications per year in each hospital on the average.', 'So again I want you to send in your questions by clicking on the Q & A budget and then will resume in another area about the training of oncological surgeons.', \"And here's a very important point, although we talk about surgical oncology and super specialisation, the American Board of Surgery, which certifies all general surgeons and general surgery based specialties, include surgical oncology including head and neck surgery among its core areas that are included in its board exams.\", 'So surgical oncology and the understanding about the role of surgery in cancer management is equally important to trauma, burns, vascular, pediatrics, critical care, and other criteria.', 'And going beyond that, are two organizations, the Society of Surgical Oncology and the European Society of Surgical Oncology, led by Dr Chandra Are here in the United States, but also including Professor Audisio representing the ESSO, and published two important papers the first showing very large variations in the training of surgical oncologists around the world, and then jointly proposing a global curriculum in surgical oncology that can be used both for training general surgeons but also as curriculum recommendations for training surgical oncology specialists, who are very important at the national level for managing very complex patients and for leading the training programs of general surgeons.', 'And, our curriculum features both in the United States and in these global curriculum included the distinguishing features of surgical oncologists, who manage complex operations, who are part of a multidisciplinary team that involved medical and radiation oncology in treatment planning for patients at the outset of their diagnosis and participate as an oncologist in long term disease management of the cancer patient.', 'And, this recently the American Board of Surgery has approved a new certificate in complex general surgical oncology, acknowledging that there is a sufficient amount of specialized material that justifies a separate sub-board in complex general surgical oncology.', 'Now in a formal level and this comes along the Board certifications in medical oncology, pediatric oncology and radiation oncology there is now a separate Board in complex general surgical oncology.', 'And this two year training involves additional training in multi-disciplinary cancer care, surgical management of oncology conditions, patient counseling on cancer prevention and intervention, and very importantly, the participation and leadership in clinical research and clinical trial design.', 'And this includes such things that actually all general surgeons managing breast cancer for example and especially those surgical oncologists who specialize in breast cancer, need to know how to use ultrasound and core needle biopsy.', 'And I say this because in my travels to other countries there are still many community based centers ,were doing an open biopsy, as to make the diagnosis of breast cancer is the standard of care.', 'Whereas, in the specialty hospitals and in many centres in Europe and in the United States, even at the community level, the standard of care is to use a core needle biopsy instead of an open biopsy, as the preferred treatment for patients with a first diagnosis of breast cancer.', 'Now in these next few slides, I want to emphasize what is a very important part of the surgical patients here in breast cancer in patients who present with stage three disease, that with contemporary chemotherapy and systemic and targeted therapy, patients are now achieving a pathological complete response in forty to sixty percent of such patients, and this is going to change how we manage patients surgically because surgery may not be the first modality of treatment.', 'Here in breast cancer in the United States the majority of breast cancer patients with stage two and stage three breast cancer and I think in many centers in Europe especially for stage three disease, they had systemic therapy is the first treatment and then surgery is the second treatment, so there are many different planning that we have to do with our colleagues in medical oncology about the timing of surgery, the role of the sentinel node which is different in this setting, but this does represent the future of our treatments for many diseases for which breast cancer is the prototype that will change.', \"But here's another example, here is a patient with both bulky and unresectable advanced melanoma in the groin and pelvis, who was treated with immunotherapy and after immunotherapy had such a shrinkage that it facilitated the operation, and in fact in this patient when all these masses were removed they were all containing chronic inflammation and scar. This patient had a pathological complete response which could not have been stage without surgical resection of the tumor masses that originally were detected.\", 'So the future of cancer systemic therapy is changing dramatically, there are more effective therapies and in fact many of the new therapies are going to be oral therapies that are much less toxicity and will impact in the surgical patient.', 'Here is just an example of where new oral or subcutaneous agents are available for a variety of cancer types.', 'Just to give you some examples, these are the more dramatic examples, but they are getting to be more typical.', 'This is a patient who had extensive metastatic melanoma that even after two weeks of therapy you can see the PET/CT scan showed dramatic reductions in this extensive tumor.', 'And these agents are so powerful, they are already beginning to be applied in stage three melanoma patients.', 'The other major advance that is happening is the use of immunotherapy with the new checkpoint inhibitors, which now have activity in over seventeen different types of cancer, and this does represent our future that will be used increasingly in surgical patients.', 'But just to give you a few individual examples so that you have some idea about the future of therapy, here is an example of a very large melanoma metastasis, that after a single dose of combination immunotherapy this patient had a pathological complete response, demonstrated by surgical excision of the remaining tissue.', \"And here's maybe a more famous example, our US President Jimmy Carter, this is in the public arena, presented with liver and brain metastasis. and at age ninety two was treated for a short interval with a single dose of a anti pd1 checkpoint inhibitor.\", 'He has now been disease free and in complete remission for over fourteen months, with this single agent in a patient who is much older and tolerated this treatment.', 'I wanted to show yet another example of a patient with head & neck cancer that was ninety six, extensive disease and even after four weeks with this anti pd1 single therapy had a dramatic response.', \"So if we're seeing these kind of treatment responses in patients with more advanced disease, you can be sure that this will migrate into the treatment of patients with earlier disease, such as stage two and stage three cancers.\", 'So how are we as practicing surgeons going to keep up with these rapidly advancing fields, both fields in systemic therapy, radiation therapy and either in also technological advances in the operating room and new advances in biomarkers used to select patients for these different treatments.', 'And here again, there are a whole variety of ways that this is happening, with live meetings, especially those conducted by the SSO and the ESSO and BASO. But also through affiliations with the tertiary centers such as in my institution, with community hospitals, with advances in journals, with email collaborations or with live webinars, such as this webinars that is being conducted by the European Institute of Oncology.', 'Both Dr Audisio and I, are the editors-in-chief of our two respected journals and we would commend those to you, for keeping up with the field, both the online version and the print version.', 'The Society of Surgical Oncology also now has a self assessment program, that is conducted to help surgeons keep up with the field in oncology.', \"And, increasingly we're using telemedicine in the United States, that is increasingly being integrated into the ongoing operations of hospital specialty departments, home health agencies, private physician offices, and in some cases even for educational purposes in the consumer's home.\", 'So telemedicine is increasingly being used not only in the United States but around the world, both for medical education to physicians, especially those in the community setting and those in more rural areas, and also for specialist consultative services, especially in helping in patient care decision making, in other locations or even in other nations.', 'The technology allows us now to, with high resolution, to view images of x- rays, images of pathology, and even to do, to look at ultrasound images real time, that are being conducted in another site and transmitted electronically to a central site by telemedicine.', \"I've even been involved in a company called Cancer Expert Now, I'm the president of Cancer Expert Now International, where we do consultation with physicians.\", 'This shows an example by telemedicine, of one of our neuro oncologists doing a consultation with a physician in another country on a complicated patient with a brain tumor.', 'And, this shows just another example where I was in Huangshan, China. And we conducted a telemedicine virtual tumor board, here with Dr Hope Rugo, who was in San Francisco at the time, discussing a complicated patient with breast cancer.', 'And here is, right after this, a televideo at this, in the same location, on a complex colon cancer patient with Dr Glen Balch who is chief of colorectal surgery at Emory in Atlanta.', 'Again just showing the illustrations about how virtual tumor boards can be used to help in the advice and recommendations for patients with complex cancer, now anywhere in the world.', 'And I just included this slide, for an abstract that was presented last year at ASCO, showing that ninety one percent of virtual tumor board attendees found it to be very helpful, and one hundred percent of the attendees felt that the quality of care was improved.', \"Alright and then again we're almost finishing our talk, I'm going to do the summary shortly.\", 'And just as a reminder to do your Q & A buttons as I summarize.', 'So how do we as surgeons adapt to a change in a rapidly changing cancer patients?', 'It is clear in the United States and I think in many parts of Europe and elsewhere in the world, that many cancer patients will receive more than one modality of treatment. And that contemporary cancer care is a team approach, combining the collective wisdom of surgeons, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists, and other times with their pathology and radiation oncology.', 'It is clear with the advances in effective systemic therapy, that cancer is becoming a chronic or curable disease.', 'Breast cancer is a very good example of that.', 'And after all of these intensive treatments, survivorships in patients who are living for years after their treatment, are at risk for second primarys, treatment compliance, and the consequences of their intensive multi-disciplinary treatment.', 'The oncology field is one of the most rapidly advancing and changing specialities in all of medicine, and that means that we as surgeons have to keep up through continuing education and incorporate these changes into the curriculum of our trainees.', \"And it's also important to validate these advances in surgical patients systematically through clinical trials.\", \"And as I've tried to emphasize there is a continuing partnerships of professional organizations, especially in the United States, in Europe, on physician continuing education, that has to occur for lifetime. And in improving the curriculum of general surgeons and general surgery based specialities in all, all institutions throughout the world.\", 'Surgeons in order to achieve a better outcome, are going to need to partition their patients and identify those, for which specialisation or referral to high volume centres specializing in certain diseases, will have a better outcome for treating patients with complex or advanced cancers.', \"And there's both a public and even a government demand for getting optimal care from specialists, multi-disciplinary cancer centres, and regionalization of cancer therapy.\", \"However, it's important to emphasize, this does not mean that all cancer patients need to be treated by specialists, especially if there's a diagnosis that's made early and the treatment is standard and does not need multiple specialties for their care.\", 'We really believe that patients should stay in their local environment, as much as possible, and this is where things like telemedicine may have a role in helping ensure that patients, even in a smaller community hospital, are getting advice and treatment planning, with input from specialists through telemedicine or consultation.', 'And, that those of us who specialize as surgical oncologist, should be educational and research leaders among the general surgery community.', \"Now I'm almost finished with my talk, in the summary the professional societies, such as the society I represent, the Society of Surgical Oncology and previously I was CEO of ASCO, the european SSO, the American College of Surgeons, ASCO, are examples of organizations that can be important components of defining the standards for treating surgical patients with cancer and providing education, training, workshops to help other surgeons achieve optimal cancer care.\", 'And, that the partnerships across their professional societies, which is well developed between the Europeans in American SSO organizations, will advance our specialty and improve the care for our patients.', 'So that is my conclusion, I will now turn this over to Professor Audisio for his comments and to answer any questions that you may have made during this discussion.', 'Thank you very much.', 'Thank you Charles, we have no words to be grateful to Professor Balch for summarizing the present and the future of good quality cancer surgery worldwide.', 'And I really mean worldwide because this is not just the sophisticated, super advanced, surgical procedure that you might expect from an advanced tertiary referral center, this is a philosophy, this is a very basic attitude, that we should all embrace even in a district general hospital, there is room and there is need for some kind of surgeons, who is aware of the multi-disciplinarity of the oncological practice, and he was keener to talk to different specialties, then offer his own his/her own patients, the most appropriate treatment.', \"So am I right to say, Professor Balch, that the bring home message is that good quality cancer surgery is expected, is demanded and it's a worldwide need not just from top cancer units, but from most, from actually all district hospitals as well?\", \"That's absolutely true and I think the professional organizations and governments in each nation, need to insist that their citizens get high quality care and ensure, in each nation, that there are well trained surgeons, that there are organizational systems, such as regional cancer centers, and I think increasingly that there are relationships internationally with individuals or with organizations, medical centers and cancer centers, that can be of assistance for consultation in complex patients, and in education of the surgeons in the local communities and even in the more provincial or national cancer centers in hospitals.\", \"For example, next weeky, that I'm doing a multi-disciplinary tumor board with a provincial hospital in China, and part of our theme is going to be, how we can increase our use of televideo in order to increase access for the doctors in China with experts to help in the intellectual decision making for complex cancer patients.\", 'I think this is a very hot topic and perhaps we want to spend a little bit more time on how best to facilitate these.', \"We've just, you've just point out how the network is there, and I would encourage young surgeons in training to feel absolutely free to follow their dreams, study their topics, and when they meet the big professor at the meeting the pull the sleeve and, and, contact specialist, top specialists, then feel free to communicate with them, perhaps engage with them in the discussion and feel comfortable enough to take advantage of the large network that is available through the SSO, the American Society of Surgical Oncology, and the European one as well, we're at the moment working on facilitating these for developing countries in Africa, through the unrestricted grant that pharmaceutical companies are making available ,this is in my mind, the way forward.\", 'So I encourage you guys to come and talk to Professor Balch, to myself, and to whoever you want to improve your knowledge.', \"I think the important point is we can't mandate these changes, the initiative has to come from the surgeon in the each community, from their hospital, and from their government, both their local government and their national government, to raise the level of expectations for high quality and timely care.\", 'And then work in each nation within the limitations of their resources, in order to achieve that over time.', \"Shall we also say words in warning, some easy bite on super advanced technicalities. i.e. You don't want a PET scan, when you don't have a ultrasound machine.\", \"You might consider not purchasing a robotic equipment, when you're missing a basic laparoscopic stuff, and therefore you need to develop the system, as you're saying, step by step according to the local facilities at a regional or provincial level.\", \"Yes it's absolutely true, I've been in one major hospital in Africa which has a very expensive radiation therapy machine that is still in boxes because they don't have the radiation physicists or the radiation technicians for the service component, but they have the machine in a box, that somebody bought, but it's more than that.\", 'So it takes planning at the government level and at the hospital level, to make sure to define, not just the capital expenditures of buildings and equipment but the delivery of the services by qualified and trained individuals, at all levels.', \"So, Professor Balch, we always have enemies and allies, when we want to achieve a target, and that's a bit of a silly and restrictive way to look at it. But it has been the case that most surgical oncologists would blame the general surgeons for not embracing an oncological attitude or philosophy and on the other hand, some medical oncologists are wiping surgeons skills under the carpet.\", 'Are we right to say that we actually need everyone and we welcome everyone on board, because this is an ongoing discussion which is just a pleasure to create together as it develops.', 'I agree, and I think the point here is that the surgeon has to be involved in the treatment planning.', \"As you and I have talked about there are other specialties and surgeons who spend all their time in the operating room, and allowed the internal medicine trained person to get at the front and make all the decisions and now in that specialty and I'm talking about cardiac surgery, the surgeon is the court of last resort, after all medical treatments have failed.\", \"And my concern that if the surgeon doesn't bring the surgical perspective to the treatment planning, and is engaged with the medical oncologist and radiation oncologist, the patients may not get the full advantage of a true multi-disciplinary treatment approach that does involve surgery, but we are best trained and have the experience to determine what's the best timing of surgery in some combination and sequence.\", 'If we are not at the table, we will be the court of last resort after all else fails with medical treatment and radiation treatment.', 'So we have to be engaged in the treatment planning at the outset.', \"Yeah good so once again we totally embrace a multi-disciplinary attitude, where more and more perhaps new figures are taking part for example, I'm thinking of interventional radiologists that only maybe a decade or two decades ago were almost unknown but nowadays there's this stent strictures, they put catheters, they deliver medication and isotopes, and so once again let's straightly reiterate the point that, we want everyone on board here.\", \"I'm taking advantage of the time because I understand from the organizer that there is a problem with the questions coming in and this has not been made available today, there is a technical hiccup.\", \"So we do apologise for this and let's make sure that if you have any question you definitely can come back, the audience can definitely come back to me and Professor Balch in writing and we will be pleased to provide any, any answer or satisfy any request.\", \"But I'm very pleased to be part of this important session and to join you, an internationally renowned surgical oncologist, in this educational forum by televideo.\", \"I'm also very grateful to the European School of Oncology, cause we often feel that the surgical team is a bit neglected so, I'd like to congratulate ESO for this and perhaps you know, twist their arm and make sure that more space and more interest is devolved towards what surgeons are doing.\", 'Is there any conclusive note that you would like to underline Professor Balch?', \"Yes, I'd like you to get the last word, I purposely planted the slides about breast cancer management in Great Britain, a high income place.\", \"And it's my understanding that subsequent to that time around the year 2002-2004, the British government really did engage in cancer center, in regionalization and that the care in breast cancer has greatly improved.\", \"You live in that arena and you've witnessed that, now wonder if you would just comment because one of our themes is there is a need for some level of specialisation, even in breast cancer.\", \"Okay, I'm gonna share my thoughts with you and the participants.\", \"I'm sure that, I hope that I'm not offending anybody, but the story goes that, when I first came to this country in 99, breast surgery was dealt with by the most clumsy surgeons, they were perhaps not very skilled for a visceral surgery, so they were relegated to a subcutaneous cancer surgeon.\", 'And therefore, the cosmetic outcomes were unbelievable, and the oncological results were also very, very poor.', \"And those days, we were still suffering of the egos, that you know surgeons can do everything, or you don't need, I've cured you, you don't need any chemo, you don't need any radio, you just come back to me in six months, in one year and you're sorted.\", 'Now, fortunately, there has been a desire, a decision to establish dedicated breast surgeons.', 'The old guys have retired and now there are more and more young people who are really focusing on breast only.', 'And this means that they are not doing the on call in the night, they are simply focusing on breast cancer surgery.', \"Also Professor Audisio, isn't it true that there's been an establishment of cancer centers, on a regional basis that, not only for breast but for other diseases, has elevated the quality of care.\", \"Yes definitely so, this is particularly true for advanced cancer surgery, as you pointed out, liver surgery, pancreatic surgery, sarcomas, peritoneal disease, there is no point in having twenty units across the country, we have four accredited fully audited, and nicely scrutinised and beautifully performing unit, so that's that's the setting.\", 'But the point i was making is that, I think the young generation is now embraced, as you were saying before, the idea of working together and deciding yes surgical issues but at what time? in which patients? how aggressive should we be?', 'And, and what is left after surgery?', 'And, we are definitely improving on this and the results are there, the cancer outcomes have improved.', \"I'm not sure that I can quote it due to the, this the establishment of the multi-disciplinary team, but it's definitely true that this cohesive philosophy, this harmonic approach to the cancer patients has definitely milliard improved the the outcomes.\", 'Yeah, and I think the teaching point the summary of all of this talk is that, surgeons have to play a role in this rapidly advancing field and that tragically billions of people are not getting access to safe, affordable and timely care.', 'And I think all of us need to redouble our efforts to help cancer patients throughout the world, so that regardless of where they live, they can gain access, either by a more educated and trained local physician, or referral to a regional centre.', 'And that the education process, is enhanced in every country so that we can all keep up with this rapidly growing field and be able to safely introduce these new therapies, as they are approved by governments and insurance schemes.', 'I am very grateful Professor Balch for your time, for your wise vision, and for sharing your thoughts with us.', 'I just want to say you grazie molte, grazie, ciao ciao, arrivederci, grazie Thank you Professor Balch and thank you Professor Audisio.', 'Ladies and gentlemen the session has now concluded.', 'If interested in CME accreditation,

            "['Buenos días, buenas tardes, buenas noches.', 'Les habla la presentadora de la conferencia.', 'La Escuela Europea de Oncología les da la bienvenida a su sesión virtual 404.', 'La sesión virtual de hoy está dedicada al impacto de la cirugía oncológica en los resultados.', 'Le recordamos que esta actividad está acreditada por el CME.', 'Al final de la presentación, al cerrar la ventana de retransmisión, se le redirigirá a la evaluación de CME y al test de opciones múltiples.', 'Se pedirá a los Mastermind competitors que empiecen el test una vez finalizada la evaluación.', 'Como recordatorio durante la sesión en directo, todos los participantes pueden formular preguntas en directo en cualquier momento, simplemente pulsando el botón correspondiente en la parte superior de la página.', 'Esto es un extracto de la política que se publica en nuestro sitio web en su totalidad.', 'Las preguntas serán recibidas por el profesor Riccardo Audisio del Western Hospital, Universidad de Liverpool, Prescott, Reino Unido, quien las comentará con el profesor Charles M. Balch del MD Anderson Cancer Center de la Universidad de Texas, Houston, Texas, EE. UU.', 'Ahora le concedemos la palabra al Profesor Balch.', 'Profesor, su micrófono está abierto.', 'Hola a todos.', 'Soy Charles Balch de Houston, Texas, y me complace unirme a este seminario web para hablar sobre el impacto de los resultados quirúrgicos oncológicos y también participo en esto con mi buen amigo el profesor Riccardo Audisio, ex presidente de la Sociedad Británica de Oncología Quirúrgica y el presidente electo de la Sociedad Europea de Oncología Quirúrgica y él moderará una ronda de preguntas y respuestas al final de mi presentación.', 'Así que voy a exponer brevemente mis diapositivas, pero espero que más adelante descarguen varios artículos que creo que son documentos fundamentales que involucran cirujanos de todo el mundo, y que provienen de la Comisión Lancet que se publicaron en 2015 en Lancet Oncology.', 'El primero de ellos fue sobre cirugía global en el año 2030 y voy a leer unas citas de estos artículos.', 'La primera es que el acceso a la atención quirúrgica es esencial para reducir la mortalidad y morbilidad por afecciones quirúrgicas, sin embargo y esto es realmente un hecho importante y alarmante.Más de 2000 millones de personas no tienen acceso a la cirugía y la anestesia y, además, esta cifra está probablemente subestimada.', 'Por lo tanto, el acceso universal a una atención quirúrgica segura y asequible es fundamental.', 'En un artículo posterior en el que participamos el Dr. Audisio y yo, en Lancet Oncology, nos centramos en la cirugía oncológica global y en cómo administrar una cirugía oncológica segura, asequible y oportuna y realmente yo recomendaría que todos los que nos están escuchando lo leyeran.', 'Bueno, este artículo fue publicado en Lancet Oncology en 2015 y como pueden ver en las flechas el Dr. Audisio y yo fuimos sus coautores y parte del resumen que voy a destacar muy brevemente indicaba que para el año 2030, para lo que solo faltan trece años, calculamos que serán necesarios 45 millones de procedimientos quirúrgicos en todo el mundo y sin embargo menos del 25% de los pacientes de cáncer en todo el mundo realmente consiguen una cirugía segura, asequible u oportuna.', 'Así que queda mucho trabajo por hacer a este respecto y citaré algunas cosas más de este artículo en Lancet Oncology; que los problemas del acceso a la cirugía, la escasez de inversión en sistemas quirúrgicos públicos, la baja inversión en investigación, en formación, en cirugía y las brechas en formación están notablemente extendidas en todo el mundo.', 'Y hemos ofrecido soluciones que incluyen, un sistema público mejor regulado, especialmente en la formación y la certificación de cirujanos, colaboraciones internacionales, súper centralización de los servicios quirúrgicos y, volveré a hablar de esto más tarde, nuevos ensayos clínicos quirúrgicos, y nuevos enfoques para mejorar la calidad y el escalamiento de los sistemas de cirugía oncológica cáncer a través de la formación y la capacitación.', 'Les daré algunos ejemplos más adelante en esta conferencia.', 'Continuando con algunas declaraciones más resumidas de este importante artículo, lograr buenos resultados en la cirugía oncológica moderna es algo técnicamente exigente y es sabido que los resultados mejoran cuando dicha cirugía es realizada por equipos especializados en centros de alto volumen.', 'Y voy a entrar en esta importante estrategia con más detalle, pero haciendo hincapié en que estamos hablando de los pacientes más complicados, las operaciones más complicadas, y en centros de alto volumen.', 'Pero creo que lo que es importante como resumen es que el acceso a la formación de alta calidad en estas unidades, con la acreditación y el control de calidad adecuados para los aspirantes a cirujanos oncológicos, todavía tiene que ser cumplido formalmente por parte de las autoridades regulatorias en un número considerable de países.', 'Y aunque los países con niveles de renta altos como muchos países de Europa y Estados Unidos están impulsando una mayor especialización, a nivel mundial se necesitan cirujanos con una formación mucho más amplia; las asociaciones profesionales quirúrgicas deben desempeñar un papel más importante en esta área y, por último, que los países con niveles de renta altos y medios tienen el deber y la oportunidad de ampliar sus ofertas formativas de cirugía oncológica a países con niveles de renta bajos a través de intercambios bilaterales, de un mayor uso de la formación reforzada por la tecnología y colaboraciones para desarrollar contenidos curriculares específicos sobre el cáncer dentro de programas de formación de residentes de cirugía general.', 'Estos son solo algunos ejemplos de las asociaciones y la disponibilidad de programas globales de formación, como la Sociedad de Oncología Quirúrgica, la Sociedad Europea, la Asociación Británica y otras muchas organizaciones como la ESMO, la ASCO, y un grupo en el que participo llamado Health Volunteers Overseas, con sede en los Estados Unidos.', 'En las siguientes diapositivas quiero destacar la importancia y el valor de la especialización en términos de calidad de la atención.', 'Ha habido avances rápidos y sustanciales en la investigación del cáncer, con nuevos diagnósticos mediante biomarcadores, nuevas terapias sistémicas que incluyen quimioterapia, terapia hormonal, terapia dirigida y, más recientemente, inmunoterapia.', 'Y esto ha dado lugar a nuevas combinaciones y secuencias de tratamientos contra el cáncer, incluidos tratamientos neoadyuvantes y adyuvantes en los pacientes quirúrgicos.', 'Así que todos los que nos dedicamos a la cirugía tenemos que estar al día en los rápidos avances de estos campos.', 'También se están produciendo grandes avances en las tecnologías quirúrgicas en el quirófano, como la cirugía laparoscópica, la cirugía robótica y las técnicas de imagen intraoperatorias.Y entonces, la pregunta es, cómo podemos extirpar el cáncer con mejores resultados y más seguros, con menor incidencia de complicaciones y mejor control local regional, y la importancia, además de la rehabilitación y el restablecimiento de la función de los pacientes después de la cirugía.', 'Y ahora hay muchos cambios en la forma de administrar atención oncológica a través del concepto regional de centros oncológicos, un equipo multidisciplinario de especialistas oncológicos que tiene que incluir cirujanos que deciden pasar parte de su tiempo como miembros de un equipo multidisciplinario y participar en la planificación del tratamiento con nuestros colegas en radiooncología médica, patología y radiología.', 'Y les mostraré algunas diapositivas que demuestran que los centros oncológicos de alto volumen y los especialistas quirúrgicos obtienen mejores resultados al tratar cánceres complejos.', 'Y como ya he dicho, en el fondo esto no significa que para las operaciones de rutina y los pacientes de rutina sea necesario especializarse porque necesitamos cirujanos generales que practiquen cirugía de alta calidad y segura, pero que tengan el criterio necesario para saber cuándo algunos pacientes deben ser transferidos a un centro regional donde podrían obtener mejores resultados.', 'Y sólo para mostrarles un ejemplo de una enfermedad frecuente, me referiré a una publicación en el British Journal of Cancer en 2004, en la que comento que las pacientes con cáncer de mama tratadas por especialistas en comparación con una unidad no especializada tenían la mitad de riesgo de recibir un tratamiento inadecuado de la mama y un riesgo cinco veces menor de someterse a una cirugía axilar inadecuada y un riesgo nueve veces menor de recibir un tratamiento axilar inadecuado; y que las tasas de recurrencia locales, que es una medida del resultado quirúrgico, era un 57% menor a los ocho años y el riesgo de muerte por cáncer de mama era un 20% menor en las mujeres tratadas en unidades especializadas.', 'Y que concluimos que el manejo quirúrgico adecuado de los centros de la mama es fundamental para mejorar el desenlace del cáncer de mama, independientemente de dónde se haga.', 'Recuerden que esto se publicó en 2004 y desde entonces el sistema sanitario británico ha desarrollado centros oncológicos mucho más grandes y una regionalización del cáncer de mama sobre la que quizá el profesor Audisio quiera comentar.', 'Pero aquí en los Estados Unidos también hubo varios artículos en ese momento que mostraban que el volumen quirúrgico afecta la supervivencia si los cirujanos realizan al menos quince o más operaciones de cáncer de mama al año y que con la especialización quirúrgica (aquellos entrenados en cirugía oncológica de la mama u oncología quirúrgica) hubo una reducción del 36% en el riesgo de muerte a los cinco años incluso después de ajustar según el volumen hospitalario, el volumen quirúrgico, la edad, el estadio y la raza de la paciente.', 'Y he aquí algunos ejemplos que he seleccionado para el New England Journal of Medicine —estudios clásicos que muestran la relación entre el volumen hospitalario y la mortalidad quirúrgica en los Estados Unidos y nos muestra que para la colectomía, una operación más estándar, no hubo una diferencia comparando el volumen hospitalario y la mortalidad ajustada sin embargo, hubo una diferencia significativa en la mortalidad relacionada con el tratamiento después de la cirugía en el caso de la gastrectomía, esofagectomía y resecciones pancreáticas.', 'Continuando, en otro artículo que analiza el volumen del cirujano, el último artículo se centraba en el volumen del hospital.El volumen del cirujano y la mortalidad quirúrgica, de nuevo hubo algunas operaciones como, atendiendo a la mortalidad quirúrgica ajustada, no hubo mucha diferencia en la resección en casos de cáncer de pulmón o la cistectomía, pero hubo una diferencia muy significativa al comparar el volumen del cirujano y la mortalidad quirúrgica en la esofagectomía y las resecciones pancreáticas.', 'Esta diapositiva es un paréntesis, sólo para recordarles que sus opiniones son importantes, pueden hacer preguntas y enviar comentarios haciendo clic en el botón Preguntas y respuestas y enviando sus preguntas para que al final de esta conferencia el profesor Audisio y yo podamos moderar un debate con sus preguntas.', 'Volviendo a mi ponencia, quería señalar que el volumen del hospital o del cirujano no siempre es lo más importante, que los factores de riesgo del paciente también son importantes y he mostrado algunas fotos de mis viajes a África o incluso de mi propia experiencia personal de pacientes que han descuidado sus tumores o que han recibido un tratamiento inadecuado al principio y sufren al final metástasis regionales extensas que podrían haberse controlado si la cirugía hubiera sido más completa o se hubiera realizado en un momento anterior en el curso de la enfermedad del paciente.', 'Esto sirve para mostrar que el estadio clínico y la comorbilidad de los pacientes, especialmente entre los pacientes de edad avanzada, también marcarán una diferencia en el resultado.', 'Así que como resumen de algunos de estos artículos del New England Journal of Medicine y de todas las publicaciones de otras publicaciones, si se compara la mortalidad postoperatoria en centros especializados, en comparación con los hospitales locales de los Estados Unidos, no hubo diferencia en diversos tumores que afectan a la mama, melanoma, ovario, próstata, tiroides y útero.', 'Sin embargo, se encontraron diferencias entre los pacientes de alto riesgo al comparar los centros especializados con los hospitales locales, lo que muestra que para los pacientes de máximo y alto riesgo hubo una diferencia significativa en las especializaciones, mientras que en los pacientes de bajo riesgo no hubo diferencia entre los centros especializados y los hospitales locales.', 'Y por último, hubo una diferencia en todos los pacientes, en estas dos áreas, páncreas y esófago, al comparar la mortalidad postoperatoriaLo que demuestra que independientemente de los factores de riesgo de los pacientes, los pacientes tratados en centros especializados presentaron una reducción significativa en la mortalidad postoperatoria en estas dos afecciones.', 'Y he aquí otro artículo del Dr. Birkmeyer en el New England Journal of Medicine, que muestra de nuevo la mortalidad hospitalaria, basada tanto en el volumen del cirujano como en el volumen hospitalario, que muestra diferencias muy significativas al relacionar volumen y resultado con respecto a la mortalidad relacionada con la cirugía a los 30 días.', 'El Colegio Estadounidense de Cirujanos ha lanzado en un programa NSQIP un programa nacional de mejora de la calidad quirúrgica, para el cual la mayoría de los hospitales de los Estados Unidos participan en estos programas NSQIP y aquí solo se muestra cuando un programa fue iniciado a nivel nacional y en este caso por el Colegio Estadounidense de Cirujanos, que el 66% de los hospitales, ahora estos son casi todos los hospitales de los Estados Unidos, incluidos los hospitales locales, que el 66% de ellos mejora la mortalidad, el 82% mejora la morbilidad, los peores resultados, es decir, los cirujanos de bajo volumen u hospitales de bajo volumen, tenían más probabilidades de mejorar, pero incluso los que tenían buenos resultados también mejoraron.', 'Y que el número de valores atípicos bajos aumentó y el número de valores atípicos altos disminuyó, lo cual es bueno tomando como base estos programas de calidad iniciados a nivel nacional.', 'Y gracias a este programa, se estimó que cada hospital evitaba 250 complicaciones por año en cada hospital en promedio.', 'De nuevo, quiero que envíen sus preguntas haciendo clic en el botón de Preguntas y respuestas y luego continuaremos en otra área sobre la formación de cirujanos oncológicos.', 'Y aquí hay un punto muy importante, aunque hablamos de oncología quirúrgica y súper especialización, la Junta Americana de Cirugía, que certifica a todos los cirujanos generales y especialidades basadas en cirugía general, incluye la oncología quirúrgica incluyendo la cirugía de cabeza y cuello entre las áreas centrales que se incluyen en sus exámenes de certificación.', 'Por lo tanto, la oncología quirúrgica y el conocimiento del papel de la cirugía en el manejo del cáncer son igualmente importantes para las quemaduras traumáticas, la pediatría vascular, la medicina intensiva y otros criterios.', 'Y yendo más allá, hay dos organizaciones, la Sociedad de Oncología Quirúrgica y la Sociedad Europea de Oncología Quirúrgica, dirigida por el Dr. Chandra Are, aquí en los Estados Unidos, pero incluyendo también al profesor Audisio representando a la ESSO, que publicaron dos importantes artículos el primero mostraba grandes variaciones en la formación de oncólogos quirúrgicos en todo el mundo, y luego proponiendo conjuntamente un plan de estudios global en oncología quirúrgica que puede ser utilizado tanto para la formación de cirujanos generales, como también como recomendaciones curriculares para la formación de especialistas en oncología quirúrgica, que son muy importantes a nivel nacional para el manejo de pacientes muy complejos y para dirigir los programas de formación de cirujanos generales.', 'Y nuestras características curriculares, tanto en los Estados Unidos como en este plan de estudios global, incluyó las características distintivas de los oncólogos quirúrgicos, que abordan operaciones complejas, que forman parte de un equipo multidisciplinario que involucraba la oncología médica y radioterápica en la planificación del tratamiento de los pacientes desde el inicio de su diagnóstico y que participan como oncólogos en el manejo a largo plazo del paciente con cáncer.', 'Y, recientemente, la Junta Americana de Cirugía ha aprobado un nuevo certificado en oncología quirúrgica general compleja, reconociendo que hay una cantidad suficiente de material especializado que justifica una subcertificación independiente en oncología quirúrgica general compleja.', 'Ahora, en un nivel formal, y esto se une a las certificaciones de la Junta en Oncología Médica, Oncología Pediátrica y Oncología Radioterápica, ahora hay una Junta separada para oncología quirúrgica general compleja.', 'Y esta formación de dos años implica una formación adicional en atención multidisciplinaria del cáncer, manejo quirúrgico de enfermedades oncológicas, asesoramiento del paciente sobre prevención e intervención del cáncer y, muy importante, la participación y el liderazgo en investigación clínica y diseño de ensayos clínicos.', 'Y esto incluye cosas que realmente todos los cirujanos generales que tratan el cáncer de mama, por ejemplo y especialmente los oncólogos quirúrgicos que se especializan en cáncer de mama, necesitan saber, cómo usar la ecografía y la biopsia con aguja gruesa.', 'Y digo esto porque en mis viajes a otros países todavía hay muchos centros locales en los que hacer una biopsia abierta, para hacer el diagnóstico del cáncer de mama es el procedimiento habitual.', 'Mientras que en los hospitales especializados y en muchos centros de Europa y Estados Unidos, incluso a nivel local, el procedimiento de referencia consiste en utilizar una biopsia con aguja gruesa en lugar de una biopsia abierta, como tratamiento de elección para las pacientes con un primer diagnóstico de cáncer de mama.', 'Ahora en las siguientes diapositivas, quiero enfatizar lo que es una parte muy importante de las pacientes quirúrgicas, aquí en el cáncer de mama en pacientes que presentan enfermedad en estadio tres, que con quimioterapia simultánea y terapia sistémica y dirigida, las pacientes están logrando una respuesta patológica completa en el 40% al 60% de estas pacientes, y esto va a cambiar la forma de tratar a las pacientes quirúrgicamente porque la cirugía puede no ser la primera modalidad de tratamiento.', 'Aquí, en el cáncer de mama en los Estados Unidos, la mayoría de las pacientes con cáncer de mama en estadio dos y estadio tres y creo que en muchos centros de Europa, especialmente para el estadio tres, la terapia sistémica es el primer tratamiento y luego la cirugía es el segundo tratamiento, así que hay muchas planificaciones diferentes que tenemos que hacer con nuestros colegas de oncología médica con respecto al momento de la cirugía, el papel del ganglio centinela que es diferente en este contexto; pero esto representa el futuro de nuestros tratamientos para muchas enfermedades para las que el cáncer de mama es el prototipo que cambiará.', 'Pero aquí hay otro ejemplo, un paciente con melanoma avanzado con gran masa tumoral e irresecable en la ingle y la pelvis, que fue tratado con inmunoterapia y después de la inmunoterapia tuvo una reducción tal que facilitó la operación, y de hecho en este paciente, cuando se extrajeron todas estas masas (todas contenían inflamación crónica y cicatriz), este paciente tuvo una respuesta patológica completa que no se habría podido lograr sin la resección quirúrgica de las masas tumorales que originalmente se detectaron.', 'Así que el futuro de la terapia sistémica para el cáncer está cambiando drásticamente, hay terapias más efectivas y de hecho muchas de las nuevas terapias van a ser terapias orales que son mucho menos tóxicas y van a repercutir en el paciente quirúrgico.', 'A continuación se presenta un ejemplo de los nuevos fármacos orales o subcutáneos disponibles para diversos tipos de cáncer.', 'Solo para darles algunos ejemplos, estos son los ejemplos más drásticos, pero se están volviendo más típicos.', 'Se trata de un paciente que tenía un melanoma metastásico extenso que incluso después de dos semanas de tratamiento se puede ver que la PET/TAC mostró reducciones drásticas de este tumor extenso.', 'Y estos agentes son tan potentes que ya se están empezando a aplicar en pacientes con melanoma en estadio tres.', 'El otro gran avance que está ocurriendo es el uso de inmunoterapia con los nuevos inhibidores de los puntos de control, que ahora actúan en más de 17 tipos diferentes de cáncer, y esto representa nuestro futuro que se utilizará cada vez más en pacientes quirúrgicos.', 'Pero sólo para darles algunos ejemplos individuales para que tengan una idea del futuro de la terapia, he aquí un ejemplo de una metástasis de melanoma muy grande, que después de una dosis única de inmunoterapia combinada este paciente tuvo una respuesta patológica completa, demostrada por la resección quirúrgica del tejido restante.', 'Y este es quizás un ejemplo más famoso, nuestro presidente estadounidense Jimmy Carter, esto es en la esfera pública, que presentó metástasis hepáticas y cerebrales. Y a los 92 años fue tratado durante un corto intervalo con una dosis única de un inhibidor del punto de control anti pd1.', 'Ahora lleva libre de la enfermedad y en remisión completa durante más de catorce meses, con este agente único en un paciente que es muy mayor y toleró este tratamiento.', 'Quería mostrar otro ejemplo más de un paciente con cáncer de cabeza y cuello que tenía 96 años, enfermedad extensa e incluso después de cuatro semanas con esta terapia anti pd1 única tuvo una respuesta drástica.', 'Así que, si vemos este tipo de respuestas al tratamiento en pacientes con enfermedad más avanzada, pueden estar seguros de que esto se llevará al tratamiento de pacientes con enfermedad más incipiente, como el cáncer en estadio dos y estadio tres.', 'Entonces, como cirujanos en ejercicio, ¿cómo vamos a mantenernos al día en estos campos de rápido avance, tanto en terapia sistémica, radioterapia como en los avances tecnológicos en el quirófano y los nuevos avances en los biomarcadores utilizados para seleccionar pacientes para estos diferentes tratamientos?', 'Y aquí, una vez más, esto está sucediendo de formas muy variadas, con reuniones en vivo, especialmente las realizadas por la SSO y la ESSO y BASO, pero también a través de afiliaciones con centros de atención especializada como en mi institución, con hospitales locales, con avances en revistas, con colaboraciones por correo electrónico o con seminarios web en vivo, como este seminario web que está llevando a cabo el Instituto Europeo de Oncología.', 'El Dr. Audisio y yo somos los redactores jefe de nuestras dos respetadas revistas y se las recomendamos, para mantenerse al día en este campo, tanto en la versión en línea como en la versión impresa.', 'La Sociedad de Oncología Quirúrgica también tiene ahora un programa de autoevaluación, que se lleva a cabo para ayudar a los cirujanos a mantenerse al día en el campo de la oncología.', 'Y en los Estados Unidos usamos cada vez más la telemedicina, que se integra cada vez más en las operaciones en curso de los departamentos de especialidades de hospitales, agencias de salud domiciliaria, consultorios médicos privados, y en algunos casos incluso con fines educativos en el hogar del consumidor.', 'Así, la telemedicina se usa cada vez más no sólo en Estados Unidos sino en todo el mundo, tanto para la formación médica de los médicos, especialmente de los de centros locales y de las zonas más rurales, como para los servicios de consulta especializada, sobre todo para ayudar en la toma de decisiones de atención por parte del paciente, en otros lugares o incluso en otros países.', 'La tecnología nos permite ahora ver con alta resolución imágenes de radiografías, imágenes de patología, e incluso hacerlo, ver en tiempo real imágenes de ecografía, que se están llevando a cabo en otro sitio y se están transmitiendo electrónicamente a un sitio central mediante telemedicina.', 'Incluso he participado en una compañía llamada Cancer Expert Now, soy el Presidente de Cancer Expert Now International, donde hacemos interconsultas con otros médicos.', 'Aquí se muestra un ejemplo mediante telemedicina, de uno de nuestros neurooncólogos haciendo una interconsulta con un médico en otro país sobre un paciente complicado con un tumor cerebral.', 'Y este es sólo otro ejemplo donde estuve en Huangshan, China, e hicimos un comité virtual de telemedicina sobre tumores aquí con la Dra. Hope Rugo, que estaba en San Francisco en ese momento, para hablar sobre una paciente complicada con cáncer de mama.', 'Y aquí está, justo después de esto, una videoconferencia en la misma ubicación, sobre un paciente complejo de cáncer de colon con el Dr. Glen Balch que es jefe de cirugía colorrectal en Emory en Atlanta.', 'Nuevamente mostrando las ilustraciones de cómo los comités virtuales sobre tumores pueden ser utilizados para ayudar en el asesoramiento y recomendaciones para pacientes con cáncer complejo, ahora en cualquier parte del mundo.', 'Y he incluido esta diapositiva, de un resumen que se presentó el año pasado en la ASCO, que muestra que el 91% de los asistentes a comités virtuales sobre tumores lo consideraron muy útil, y el 100% de los asistentes notaron que la calidad de la atención mejoraba.', 'Muy bien, y de nuevo estamos casi terminando nuestra charla, voy a hacer el resumen en breve.', 'Y solo como recordatorio para utilicen los botones de Preguntas y respuestas a medida que resumo.', 'Entonces, como cirujanos ¿cómo nos adaptamos a un cambio en pacientes oncológicos que cambian rápidamente?', 'Está claro en los Estados Unidos y creo que en muchas partes de Europa y en otros lugares del mundo que muchos pacientes de cáncer recibirán más de una modalidad de tratamiento, y que la atención del cáncer contemporánea es un enfoque de equipo, que combina la sabiduría colectiva de cirujanos, oncólogos médicos, oncólogos radioterápicos y otras veces con su patología y oncología radioterápica.', 'Con los avances en la terapia sistémica eficaz es evidente que el cáncer se está convirtiendo en una enfermedad crónica o curable.', 'El cáncer de mama es un muy buen ejemplo de ello.', 'Y después de todos estos tratamientos intensivos, la supervivencia en pacientes que viven durante años después de su tratamiento están en riesgo de sufrir de segundas neoplasias primarias, cumplimiento del tratamiento y las consecuencias de su tratamiento intensivo multidisciplinario.', 'El campo de la oncología es una de las especialidades que más rápidamente avanza y cambia en toda la medicina, y eso significa que nosotros como cirujanos tenemos que mantenernos al día a través de la formación continua e incorporar estos cambios en el plan de estudios de nuestros alumnos.', 'Y también es importante validar estos avances en pacientes quirúrgicos sistemáticamente a través de ensayos clínicos.', 'Y como he tratado de enfatizar, hay una colaboración continua de organizaciones profesionales, especialmente en los Estados Unidos, en Europa, en la formación continua de médicos, que tiene que ocurrir permanentemente, y para mejorar el plan de estudios de los cirujanos generales y las especialidades de cirugía general en todas las instituciones del mundo.', 'Los cirujanos para lograr un mejor resultado van a tener que dividir a sus pacientes e identificar aquellos para los que la especialización o derivación a centros de alto volumen especializados en ciertas enfermedades tendrá un mejor resultado para el tratamiento de pacientes con cánceres complejos o avanzados.', 'Y existe una demanda pública e incluso gubernamental de obtener una atención óptima de especialistas, de centros oncológicos multidisciplinarios y de la regionalización de la terapia oncológica.', 'Sin embargo, es importante enfatizar que esto no significa que todos los pacientes con cáncer necesiten ser tratados por especialistas, especialmente si el diagnóstico se hace pronto y el tratamiento es estándar y no necesita múltiples especialidades para su atención.', 'Realmente creemos que los pacientes deben permanecer en su entorno local todo lo posible, y aquí es donde cosas como la telemedicina pueden desempeñar un papel para ayudar a garantizar que los pacientes, incluso en un hospital local más pequeño, reciban asesoramiento y planificación del tratamiento, con aportaciones de especialistas a través de la telemedicina o la interconsulta.', 'Y que quienes nos especializamos como oncólogos quirúrgicos, deberíamos ser líderes en formación e investigación entre la comunidad de cirugía general.', 'Ya casi termino con mi charla; en resumen, las sociedades profesionales, como la sociedad que represento, la Sociedad de Oncología Quirúrgica y antes fui Director Ejecutivo de ASCO, la SSO europea, el Colegio Americano de Cirujanos, la ASCO, son ejemplos de organizaciones que pueden ser componentes importantes para definir los estándares para tratar pacientes quirúrgicos con cáncer y proporcionar formación, capacitación, talleres para ayudar a otros cirujanos a lograr una atención óptima del cáncer.', 'Y que las asociaciones entre sus sociedades profesionales, que están bien desarrolladas entre los europeos en las organizaciones estadounidenses de SSO, mejorarán nuestra especialidad y la atención de nuestros pacientes.', 'Así que esa es mi conclusión, ahora voy a pasar el testigo al profesor Audisio para escuchar sus comentarios y para responder cualquier pregunta que puedan haber hecho durante esta exposición.', 'Muchas gracias.', 'Gracias Charles, no tenemos palabras para agradecerle al profesor Balch por resumir el presente y el futuro de la cirugía oncológica de buena calidad en todo el mundo.', 'Y realmente quiero decir todo el mundo porque no es sólo el procedimiento quirúrgico sofisticado, súper avanzado que se podría esperar de un centro de referencia de asistencia especializada avanzada, esta es una filosofía, esta es una actitud muy básica, que todos deberíamos adoptar incluso en un hospital general comarcal, hay espacio y hay necesidad de cierto tipo de cirujano, que sea consciente de la multidisciplinariedad de la práctica oncológica, y que fuera más propenso a hablar con diferentes especialistas, para luego ofrecer a sus propios pacientes el tratamiento más adecuado.', 'Entonces ¿estoy en lo correcto al decir, Profesor Balch, que el mensaje con el que hay que quedarse es que la cirugía oncológica de buena calidad es algo que se espera, que se demanda y que es una necesidad mundial no sólo de las principales unidades oncológicas, sino también de la todos los hospitales comarcales?', 'Eso es absolutamente cierto y creo que las organizaciones profesionales y los gobiernos de cada país tienen que insistir en que sus ciudadanos reciban atención de alta calidad y asegurar, en cada país, que haya cirujanos bien formados, que haya sistemas organizativos, como centros oncológicos regionales, y creo cada vez más que hay relaciones internacionales con personas u organizaciones, centros médicos y centros oncológicos, que pueden ser de ayuda para la interconsulta en pacientes complejos, y en la formación de los cirujanos en las comunidades locales e incluso en los centros oncológicos más provinciales o nacionales en los hospitales.', 'Por ejemplo, la semana que viene voy a formar un comité multidisciplinario sobre tumores con un hospital provincial de China, y parte del tema a tratar va a ser cómo podemos aumentar el uso de la videoconferencia para aumentar el acceso de los médicos en China con expertos para ayudar en la toma intelectual de decisiones para pacientes oncológicos complejos.', 'Creo que este es un tema muy candente y tal vez debamos dedicar un poco más de tiempo a pensar la mejor manera de facilitar esto.', 'Acabamos, acaba usted de señalar cómo esa red existe, y yo animaría a los jóvenes cirujanos en formación a que se sientan absolutamente libres de perseguir sus sueños, estudiar sus temas, y cuando se encuentren con el gran profesor en la reunión le tiren de la manga y, y, contacten con especialistas, especialistas de primer nivel, y que luego se sientan libres de comunicarse con ellos, tal vez entablen con ellos un debate y se sientan lo suficientemente cómodos como para aprovechar la gran red que está disponible a través de la SSO, la Sociedad Estadounidense de Oncología Quirúrgica, y la europea también; estamos trabajando en este momento para facilitársela a estos países en desarrollo en África, a través del fondo no restringido que las compañías farmacéuticas están poniendo a disposición, este es, en mi opinión, el camino a seguir.', 'Así que los animo a venir y hablar con el profesor Balch, conmigo mismo, y con quien quieran para mejorar sus conocimientos.', 'Creo que lo importante es que no podemos obligar a estos cambios, la iniciativa tiene que venir del cirujano en cada comunidad, de su hospital, y de su gobierno, tanto su gobierno local como su gobierno nacional, para elevar el nivel de expectativas para una atención de alta calidad y oportuna.', 'Y luego trabajar en cada país dentro de las limitaciones de sus recursos, para lograrlo con el tiempo.', 'Hagamos también alguna advertencia, algo fácil de entender sobre técnicas súper avanzadas, es decir, no quieres un escáner PET, cuando no tienes un ecógrafo.', 'Podrías no plantearte comprar un equipo robótico, cuando te falta un aparato básico de laparoscopia, y por lo tanto necesitas desarrollar el sistema, como usted dice, paso a paso, de acuerdo con las instalaciones locales a nivel regional o provincial.', 'Sí, es absolutamente cierto; he estado en un hospital importante en África que tiene una máquina de radioterapia muy cara que aún está en cajas porque no tienen los radiólogos o los técnicos en radiología para el componente de servicio, pero tienen la máquina en una caja, que alguien compró, pero no basta con eso.', 'Así que se necesita planificación a nivel gubernamental y hospitalario, para asegurarse de definir no sólo los gastos financieros en edificios y equipos sino también la ejecución de los servicios por individuos calificados y entrenados, a todos los niveles.', 'Así, Profesor Balch, siempre tenemos enemigos y aliados cuando queremos lograr un objetivo, y esa es una forma tonta y restrictiva de verlo, pero ha ocurrido que la mayoría de los oncólogos quirúrgicos culpen a los cirujanos generales por no adoptar una actitud o filosofía oncológica y, por otro lado, algunos oncólogos médicos están barriendo las habilidades de los cirujanos hasta esconderlas bajo la alfombra.', '¿Estamos en lo cierto al decir que realmente necesitamos a todos y les damos la bienvenida a todos a bordo, porque este es un debate en curso que es un placer crear juntos a medida que se desarrolla?', 'Estoy de acuerdo, y creo que el punto aquí es que el cirujano tiene que estar involucrado en la planificación del tratamiento.', 'Como usted y yo hemos comentado hay otras especialidades y cirujanos que pasan todo su tiempo en el quirófano, y permiten que el profesional con formación en medicina interna se ponga al frente y tome todas las decisiones y ahora en esa especialidad, y estoy hablando de cirugía cardíaca, el cirujano es el tribunal de último recurso, después de que todos los tratamientos médicos hayan fracasado.', 'Y me preocupa que si el cirujano no aporta la perspectiva quirúrgica a la planificación del tratamiento, y está involucrado con el oncólogo médico y el oncólogo radioterápico, los pacientes podrían no obtener todas las ventajas de un verdadero enfoque de tratamiento multidisciplinario que implique cirugía, pero estamos mejor entrenados y tenemos la experiencia para determinar cuál es el mejor momento de la cirugía en determinada combinación y secuencia.', 'Si no estamos sentados a la mesa, seremos el tribunal de último recurso después de que todo lo demás fracase con el tratamiento médico y la radioterapia.', 'Así que tenemos que participar en la planificación del tratamiento desde el principio.', 'Sí, bueno, una vez más adoptamos totalmente una actitud multidisciplinaria, donde cada vez más y más y quizás nuevas figuras están tomando parte, por ejemplo, pienso en radiólogos intervencionistas que hace tan sólo tal vez una o dos décadas eran casi desconocidos, pero hoy en día están las estenosis de endoprótesis vasculares, ellos colocan catéteres, administran medicación e isótopos, así que una vez más vamos a reiterar claramente la idea de que queremos a todos a bordo aquí.', 'Aprovecho el tiempo porque entiendo por parte del organizador que hay un problema con la recepción de las preguntas y este servicio no ha estado disponible hoy, hay un fallo técnico.', 'Así que nos disculparemos por esto y nos aseguraremos de que si tienen alguna pregunta puedan regresar, la audiencia puede contactar conmigo y con el profesor Balch por escrito y nos complacerá responderles o satisfacer cualquier solicitud.', 'Pero me complace mucho ser parte de esta importante sesión y unirme a usted, un oncólogo quirúrgico de renombre internacional, en este foro educativo por videoconferencia.', 'También estoy muy agradecido a la Escuela Europea de Oncología, porque a menudo sentimos que el equipo quirúrgico está un poco descuidado, así que me gustaría felicitar a la ESO por esto y quizás, en fin, retorcerles el brazo y asegurarse de que se otorgue más espacio y más interés a lo que están haciendo los cirujanos.', '¿Hay alguna nota concluyente que quiera destacar, profesor Balch?', 'Sí, me gustaría que me dieran la última palabra, mostré a propósito las diapositivas sobre el tratamiento del cáncer de mama en Gran Bretaña, una región de niveles altos de renta.', 'Y tengo entendido que después de esa época alrededor del año 2002-2004, el gobierno británico se puso manos a la obra para desarrollar los centros oncológicos, la regionalización y que la atención en el cáncer de mama ha mejorado enormemente.', 'Usted se mueve en ese ámbito y ha sido testigo de ello, ahora me pregunto si le gustaría comentar algo, porque una de las cuestiones importantes para nosotros es que se necesita cierto nivel de especialización, incluso en el cáncer de mama.', 'Está bien, voy a compartir mis opiniones con usted y los participantes.', 'Estoy seguro de que, espero no ofender a nadie, pero la historia dice que, cuando llegué a este país en 1999, la cirugía de mama estaba en manos de los cirujanos más torpes, quizás no estaban muy capacitados para una cirugía visceral, así que quedaban relegados a cirugías de cáncer subcutáneo.', 'Y por lo tanto, los resultados estéticos fueron terribles, y los resultados oncológicos también fueron muy, muy deficientes.', 'Y en esos días, todavía éramos presa de los egos, que usted sabe que los cirujanos lo pueden todo, o usted no lo necesita, yo le he curado, no necesita quimio, no necesita radio, solo regrese dentro de seis meses, de un año, y está arreglado.', 'Ahora, afortunadamente, ha habido un deseo, una decisión de crear cirujanos especializados en la mama.', 'Los viejos se han retirado y ahora hay cada vez más jóvenes que realmente se centran solamente en el cáncer de mama.', 'Y esto significa que no hacen guardias nocturnas, simplemente se centran en la cirugía del cáncer de mama.', 'También profesor Audisio, ¿no es cierto que se han establecido centros de oncología regionales que, no solo para el cáncer de mama, sino para otras enfermedades, ha elevado la calidad de la atención?', 'Sí, definitivamente, esto es especialmente cierto para la cirugía de cáncer avanzado, como señaló usted, la cirugía hepática, la cirugía pancreática, los sarcomas, la enfermedad peritoneal; no tiene sentido tener veinte unidades en todo el país, tenemos cuatro unidades acreditadas totalmente auditadas, y muy bien controladas y con un rendimiento maravilloso, así que ese es el escenario.', 'Pero el punto que quería dejar claro es que creo que la generación joven está aceptando, como decía usted antes, la idea de trabajar juntos y decidir: sí, esto es una cuestión quirúrgica, pero ¿en qué momento? ¿en qué pacientes? ¿cuán agresivos deberíamos ser?', '¿Y qué queda después de la cirugía?', 'Y, definitivamente, estamos mejorando en esto y los resultados están ahí, los resultados del cáncer han mejorado.', 'No estoy seguro de que pueda citarlo debido a la, esto, la creación del equipo multidisciplinario, pero es indudablemente cierto que esta filosofía cohesionada, este abordaje armónico de los pacientes con cáncer ha mejorado extraordinariamente los resultados.', 'Sí, y creo que la enseñanza, el resumen de toda esta charla es que los cirujanos tienen que desempeñar un papel en este campo de rápido avance y que lamentablemente miles de millones de personas no tienen acceso a una atención segura, asequible y oportuna.', 'Y creo que todos nosotros tenemos que intensificar nuestros esfuerzos para ayudar a los pacientes de cáncer de todo el mundo, para que, independientemente de dónde vivan, puedan tener acceso, ya sea a través de un médico local más formado y capacitado o mediante la derivación a un centro regional.', 'Y que el proceso formativo se mejore en todos los países para que todos podamos estar al día en este campo en rápido crecimiento y podamos introducir de manera segura estas nuevas terapias, a medida que estén aprobadas por los gobiernos y los planes de seguros.', 'Le estoy muy agradecido Profesor Balch por su tiempo, por su sabia visión y por compartir sus pensamientos con nosotros.', 'Solo quiero decirles grazie molte, grazie, ciao ciao, arrivederci, grazie Gracias Profesor Balch y gracias Profesor Audisio.', 'Damas y caballeros, la sesión ha concluido.', 'Si están

            "['Hola a todos,', 'Es un placer estar aquí y haber sido invitado por el profesor Franco a compartir con ustedes mi experiencia sobre la evaluación de planes de tratamiento en radioterapia.', 'Soy Nuria Jorret. Soy consultor médico físico, jefe clínico de física de radiación en el hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau en Barcelona.', 'so the learning objectives of this lecture will be to give you an overview of the radiation therapy treatment process', 'we will analyze the different angles of treatment plan quality because at the end of this session i would like you to have a critical assessment of plan quality whenever you are facing a treatment plan produced by the medical physicist', \"and also because it's very important if you have to design the radiotherapy guidelines for clinical trials and also for internal treatment protocols\", 'so the revision therapy treatment what does it involve', 'Básicamente, tendremos un paciente que venga a nuestro departamento y el radiólogo decidirá si tratar y en este caso, prescribirá el tratamiento.', 'Entonces se someterá a alguna imagen, generalmente usando.', 'Y de esas imágenes, los radiólogos oncológicos delinearán los volúmenes que quieren tratar y los volúmenes que quieren proteger.', 'All this information will go to the physics department that they will work on their computers to produce a treatment plan achieving the treatment prescription of the radiation oncologist.', 'And here we will perform most of our plan evaluation.', 'Sin embargo, sabemos que este plan se entregará al paciente en diferentes fracciones.', 'The patient will come different days to the treatment, to the radiotherapy department, go into the treatment unit and we will deliver the treatment.', 'so the the thing that we should ask ourselves is whether this treatment that is being delivered agrees with the treatment that was planned and therefore with the treatment prescription by the radiation oncologist', 'so behind the scenes to make this happen so that we get a treatment that is the one that the radiation oncologist prescribed we are doing the physicist we are basically doing machine qa to warranty that everything is working fine', 'Estamos haciendo también el sistema de planificación de tratamiento.', 'Pero luego tenemos al paciente, la imagen, el plan.', 'and this part here even if we have this app under control we know that the patient also may change during the treatment for instance or that the machine the day of the treatment may not be performing as when we do our q a test', 'Entonces, ¿qué es la calidad plan?', 'De hecho, la calidad del plan es la aptitud clínica de la distribución de la dosis que se puede esperar razonablemente de un plan de tratamiento.', 'Así que calcularemos la dosis en las imágenes del paciente.', 'Y luego tendremos una evaluación de la dosis entregada, teniendo en cuenta la prescripción y también el volumen que ha sido delineado por el paciente.', \"i have put here realistically expected and it's basically because we have to take into account the uncertainties that we are facing when we are calculating the dose distribution but also delivering the dose distribution to a particular patient different actions\", 'so what are the inputs where these uncertainties come from', 'Así que básicamente, tenemos diferentes entradas, tenemos entradas que pertenecen al sistema de planificación del tren en sí.', 'Tenemos lo que llamamos el modelo B.', 'also we have how this dose is calculated inside the treatment patient', 'También tenemos el modelo de paciente.', 'Así que asumimos que el paciente, cuando tenemos las imágenes de CT y conocemos las densidades, y utilizamos esto, combinándolo con esto, para obtener la distribución final de dosis.', 'Y luego tenemos el plan de tratamiento.', 'So, and this will give us the dose distribution as is evaluated and approved by the radiation oncologist.', 'En el otro lado tenemos el tratamiento.', 'Y en el tratamiento, tendremos que considerar que tenemos el linac o la unidad de tratamiento.', 'Tenemos el paciente, el paciente real que viene a ser tratado.', 'Y luego tenemos el plan de tratamiento.', 'And this will give the deliver those distribution.', 'again if we want to assess the delivered dose distribution we will have to measure it somehow so we will have also some uncertainties here', 'Y compararemos estas dos cosas.', 'Y comparando estas dos cosas, diríamos, ok, el tratamiento fue el hígado como estaba planeado y como estaba prescrito.', 'Como pueden ver, todo esto es muy complejo y, por lo tanto, tenemos muchas incertidumbres que tenemos que tener en cuenta.', 'the the kind of basis of this this lecture is on this paper', 'there was a workshop organized by the physics committee in estro to discuss amongst experts what was plan quality in radiotherapy and also how we should evaluate the plan quality which metrics should we use', 'and we introduce you will see that the plant quality does not only depend on the calculated dose distribution but also we have to take into account the robustness and also the plant complexity', 'Y lo que haremos durante esta conferencia es ver estos tres componentes y entender mejor qué significan.', 'so the the the important message here is that plant quality is not only about the plant dose distribution', 'So basically, you have to look it from different angles to get the complete picture of how the plan at the end will be delivered.', 'Así que de nuevo, si vemos el tratamiento, tenemos al paciente aquí.

department, and the radiation oncologist will decide whether to treat, and in this case, he will prescribe the treatment.\", 'Then he will go under some imaging, usually using CT.', 'And from those images the radiation oncologist will delineate the volumes that they want to treat and the volumes they want to protect.', 'All this information will go to the physics department, that they will work on their computers to produce a treatment plan, achieving the treatment prescription of the radiation oncologist.', 'And here we will perform most of our plan evaluation.', 'However, we know that this plan will be delivered to the patient in different fractions.', 'The patient will come, different days, to the treatment, to the radiation therapy department, go into the treatment unit, and we will deliver the treatment.', 'So, the thing that we should ask ourselves is whether this treatment that is being delivered, agrees with the treatment that was planned, and therefore with the treatment prescription by the radiation oncologist.', 'So, behind the scenes to make this happen, so that we get a treatment, that is the one that the radiation oncologist prescribed, we are doing, the physicists, we are basically doing machine QA to guarantee that everything is working fine.', 'We are doing also Treatment Planning System QA; we have a standard test for that.', 'But then we have the patient, the imaging, treatment planning.', 'And this part here, even if we have this under control, we know that the patient also may change something in the treatment, for instance, or that the machine, the day of the treatment, may not be performing as well with our QA tests.', 'So, what is plan quality?', 'In fact, plan quality is the clinical suitability of the delivered dose distribution that can be realistically expected from a treatment plan.', 'So, we will calculate the dose on the images of the patient.', 'And then we will have an assessment of the delivered dose, taking into account the prescription, and also the volume that had been delineated by the patient.', 'I have put here \" realistically expected\", and it\\'s basically because, we have to take into account the uncertainties that we are facing when we are calculating the dose distribution, but also delivering the dose distribution to a particular patient, different fractions.', 'So, what are the inputs where these uncertainties come from?', 'So basically, we have different inputs, we have inputs which belong to the treatment planning system itself.', 'We have what we call the Beam model.', 'Also, we have how this dose is calculated inside the treatment patient.', 'We also then, we have the Patient model.', 'So, we assume that the patient, when we have the CT images and we know the densities, and we will use this combined with this to get the final dose distribution.', 'And then we have the Treatment Plan.', 'So, this will give us the dose distribution as is evaluated and approved by the radiation oncologist.', 'On the other side, we have the treatment.', 'And in the treatment, we have to consider that we have the LINAC, or the treatment unit.', 'We have the patient, the real patient that is coming to be treated.', 'And then we have the Treatment Plan.', 'And this will give the delivered dose distribution.', 'Again, if we want to assess the delivered dose distribution, we will have to measure it somehow, so we will have also some uncertainties here.', 'And we will compare these two things.', 'And by comparing these two things, we will say, \" Okay, the treatment was delivered as it was planned, and as it was prescribed\".', 'As you can see, all this is very complex, and therefore we have a lot of uncertainties that we have to take into consideration.', 'The basis of this lecture is on this paper.', 'There was a workshop organized by the Physics Committee in ESTRO, to discuss amongst experts, what was plan quality in radiotherapy, and also how we should evaluate the plan quality, which metrics should we use?', 'And we introduce, you will see, that the plan quality does not only depend on the calculated dose distribution, but also, we have to take into account the robustness and also the plan complexity.', \"And what we'll be doing during this lecture is to look at these three components and understand better, what do they mean?\", 'So, the important message here is that plan quality is not only about the planned dose distribution.', 'So basically, you have to look at it from different angles to get the complete picture of how the plan at the end will be delivered.', \"So again, if we see the treatment plan, we have the patient here, you see that this patient is a little bit overweight, that's one thing to see, for the patient on the session is coming differently.\", 'So, this is something that can happen.', 'But anyway, you have the patient, you will go through the planning CT, you will have the patient model, the radiation oncologist will design the volumes, will prescribe the dose.', 'And then we will go through treatment planning.', 'And we will provide the radiation oncology a dose distribution, that will be highly impacted by the accuracy of our dose calculation algorithms.', 'This is something that the physicists know, and the radiation oncologists trust, hold on, for trusting us, on that this is accurate.', 'But there are different uncertainties.', 'Then, we will transfer all the data to our treatment unit, and the patient will come for treatment delivery.', 'And you see that the patient will come several times.', 'So, we have to take into account the plan deliverability, which means, is this plan that we produce in our treatment planning system, being well-delivered by our treatment unit?', 'Can the treatment unit have some limitations that mean that this plan is not delivered exactly as we thought?', 'Gantry speeds, multi-leaf speeds, these kinds of things.', 'And also, we have to account, that very well because we are all doing onboard imaging nowadays, or most of us, we know that the patient may change from one fraction to the other.', 'So, we have to account also for patient radiation, and in order to do that, we have to ensure that this plan is robust.', 'So, it has to be robust to the patient variations, and also to the treatment delivery.', 'And this is very popular now with protons, because we have, we know that range is highly affected by the patient variations.', \"And everybody listens or looks at publications on planned robustness, but it's a concept that can be... it should be also applied to our standard treatments using protons or electrons.\", \"So, remember that you can post questions on the chat, and Professor Franco we'll take care of them.\", \"So, let's start, let's start with the calculated dose distribution.\", \"It's the thing that usually we use to evaluate a plan.\", \"So, let's look at this case.\", 'So usually what we will do, is going slice by slice, or this is what we should do.', \"Looking at the dose's distribution.\", 'This would be the best evaluation method to look at the dose distribution, but we have to be very careful on how, we use the different Isodose lines or the different tools that the treatment planning system has to show this distribution is slice by slice.', 'So, you can see here, for instance, all the isodose curves.', 'You can use colour wash with different labels, but there are other things that you can look at.', 'You can look at profiles through different structures.', 'You can look at point dose, Isodose surfaces, etc. but it is important to be careful with the visualization, for instance, some of our, when we have the Dosimetrist coming to our department and they come from other department, sometimes they only highlight 95% Isodose line, 105% and kind of 107%, but they are missing all the others.', \"So, it's something that we should consider.\", 'So be careful when you are looking at that.', 'Again, if you go through this path, you look at all these slice, you get the 3D dose distribution, you may have many slices, you have a lot of voxels.', 'You have huge amount of information.', 'There is a complex relationship between dose-anatomy and clinical response.', \"It's very difficult to quantify, as difficult to assess the clinical impact.\", \"So you will have a flavour of how this distribution but usually what traditional oncologists do, is too look at the dose-volume histograms which is a kind of summary, or it's compacting all this information in a histogram, the number of boxes, prescribing a certain dose.\", \"And this is quite usually we would, the radiation oncologist would look at, and it's what we use for treatment plan optimization, nowadays.\", \"Let's talk a little bit about Dose-volume histograms, which is what I call the Holy grail.\", \"And I would like to be somehow critical to those, at least to make you think but they really represent what they really don't represent.\", 'So why we are using dose-volume histograms?', 'We are using dose-volume histograms because many years ago, we...', 'There was a publication on the Red Journal of QUANTEC, where the toxicity of our treatments was correlated to these some points on the dose-volume histogram.', 'So, this is for the case of prostate, and you can see that they compacted, they put together information from different groups, treating prostate, and they look for the dose limits for grade two rectal toxicity.', 'And you can see, for instance, these lines, showing that there is quite a lot of good agreement with all the groups that for high doses that you have, for instance, that the volume receiving 70%...', '70 Gy should be less than 20% volume, otherwise you had a high risk, to have rectal toxicity grade two.', \"But for this publication, most of the model parameters were based on patients treated mostly without IMRT, or daily localization, so they we're not doing IGRT.\", 'And most of the studies used 1.8 or 2 Gy fractions.', 'So, from these studies, and again, putting the example of prostate and rectum, we, the community agreed on some, Dose Volumes Histogram constraints.', 'And here you can see the dose-volume histogram constraints for rectal toxicity, and you have different points in that dose volumes histogram.', 'This was revisited some years ago by Caroline Olsson, and in 2018 and you see that also for, for prostate cancer treatments, they revisited this dose-volume histogram constraints with new techniques being include, with all the cases that were included, when using IGRT.', 'It was with maximum nominal doses, little bit higher, because we have been escalating dose in prostate due to the advances in technology, and with dose fractions, 1.8 to 3 so not yet, including SBRT treatments, focal treatments, or protons, and you see that this has been revisited now and then.', \"But what is important for you to understand that this dose-volume histogram, although it's very nice tool because it compacts information, it's kind of a safety net, we use them for, optimization.\", 'Dose-volume histograms lose, spatial information.', 'So basically, if this is the rectal, and you have this high dose spots here and there, or you have them concentrated in one region, the dose-volume histogram will look exactly the same, so you are losing this special information.', 'And there is some evidence, old evidence that spatial distribution of this high doses really matters.', 'So, there is animal data from the studies from Trott in 1995, showing that colon radiation damage in rats depends on the size and shape of the radiated surface.', \"In human data, however, we don't have this collection of topographical kind of dose distributions, basically because now we have the computer power to, kind of store all this data, but we didn't have it before.\", 'Another thing that is important in dose-volume histogram, is that as usually we use the percentage of volume depending on the total rectum that we contour, then the percentage volume will change, so it depends on how you normalize.', \"So, it's something that you have to consider when you are comparing studies, you have to be very cautious of the land for instance, of rectum that you are contouring, otherwise you could run into problems, basically because you would be comparing, to the recommendations on the volume receiving a certain dose, but you would be with a different kind of percentage volume.\", 'Another thing in dose-volume histograms, and for instance, bladder and rectum is the question whether it could be more relevant a dose-surface histogram, than a volume histogram, and there was quite an interest on that many years ago, so we have a handful of publications of very famous physicists working on this kind of dose-surface histograms from the 2000-2005.', \"But at that moment, the 3D conformal radiotherapy was the standard of treatment, and they didn't find many differences while if they compare dose-volume histogram metrics based on volumes or surface, but this was because basically at that time, we were using these types of treatments, which employed a treatment planning process based on four-field box treatment.\", 'Our dose distribution was very, very similar and the dose-volume histograms, even if they lose, special information, described in a similar way, dose distributions that in the background were very, very similar, there was a correlation between the dose-volume histogram metric and the 3D doses distribution because we were doing more or less the same.', 'What happens now?', 'Now we have modulation, we have IMRT and VMAT, we have different techniques, and then we can have two histograms hiding, completely different 3D dose distributions in the background.', 'So, I did this exercise, so this is a prostate and I played with it.', 'I did that kind of lattice here and all these, dose-volume histograms, they, I can match, the dose-volume histograms, but what is behind them is a completely different dose distribution.', 'So, at this moment, this nice correlation between the dose volume histogram metric and the 3D dose distribution is not longer through.', \"So, what is the message here, is basically that maybe it's the moment to think on better metrics to describe dose distribution so that we can better correlate these, the dose distribution to toxicity.\", 'And just to show you some of the work that is being done in this respect, here you can see how we are revisiting again, these, dose-surface histogram, and not only that, but also looking at where these high doses concentrate in the surface of the rectum and seeing whether this correlates to different types of toxicities.', 'So in this study, they find significant relations on the defecation urgency and faecal leakage explained by high doses at the central, and the upper part of the rectum and also emptying difficulties were explained by longitudinal extensions of intermediate doses.', 'This is another study from VoxTox in 2015 also, and they look here at the delivered dose distribution by doing the same exercise.', 'So, looking at the distribution of these high doses on the rectal surface and correlating them with the toxicity they found.', \"Other studies, which are really powerful and are being performed by Italian colleagues, by Laura Cella and Marcel van Herk, at the Christie's in Manchester, they are really looking at the distribution of the doses with the boxes and looking whether the boxes with high doses position correlate with the toxicity, and they have done that for the heart and lung treatments, and this is giving really kind of a very powerful data to understand better where are the issues, when we are looking at the toxicity and not only looking at one point in the dose-volume histogram.\", \"So, and this could be, how do we assess the calculated dose distribution, but now let's talk a little bit about robustness.\", 'And the robustness is related to the question, whether we are 100% sure that the dose-volume histogram metrics match what the patient receives.', \"It's another thing.\", 'So basically, all the studies I have shown, they were looking at the plan dose distribution, and they were looking at the toxicity, but there can be a gap between what we think, what we plan, and what the patient receives.', 'And we will look at this now.', 'So basically, this is the process on a regarding patient specific QA, and now we will focus on this part here so on the IGRT.', 'Now we have a very powerful tool to check what we are doing.', 'One is IGRT, so doing images before the treatment, during the treatment with the patient on the couch, every fraction.', 'And then also we can incorporate here, In vivo dosimetry measuring or assessing the dose during the treatment.', \"So, this is also from VoxTox study we were talking about, and, and here's our 10 prostate patients.\", 'And you can see each patient is one colour, and this is the difference in dose, okay, in Gy, respect the volume of the rectum for each different fraction.', 'And you can see that for the rectum, you can have difference for one patient as high as 20% dose.', 'No, 20 Gy.', 'No, 20%...', 'I would say, percentage.', 'But anyway, you can see that for some patients, it goes quite well, for the patients you have a difference.', 'If you look at the 40 Gy Isoline, you can see that you can have difference in the percentage volume of 40%.', 'So, in matters, here is another study also from 2010, and you can see how the rectum is changing from one fraction to the other, and this has a high impact for some patients on the dose-volume histogram distribution.', \"These groups also saw is that the correlations with rectal bleeding and proctitis were achieved were stronger, if we take into account the delivered dose and not the planned dose, which is something that if you think about it, is rather obvious because it's what the patient has really received.\", 'The thing is that we should try to match as much as possible, the dose distribution that we have planned with the dose distribution that we are delivering, or we should calculate what the patient has received to use this information, to drive the models on toxicity, for instance.', 'And this is how we could go, So, what I was telling either we estimate the delivered dose metrics, or we try that the delivered dose matches as much as possible, the planned dose.', 'How can we do that?', 'With patient instructions, preparation...', \"So that, it's very consistent between planning and delivery, to use IGRT, image guidance with cone beam CT or magnetic resonance, to look at the registration surrogates.\", 'So, this is very important.', 'So, to train the RTTs in the treatment units, how they should match and how they should evaluate these IGRT images, we can adapt, we can track, or we can do robust or probabilistic plan planning.', 'So here we have a summary of where we are at now.', 'So, we are looking at the dose delivered to the patient, and we can have these uncertainties being, having an impact here.', \"So, the uncertainty in the 'emitted fluence' the linac or the uncertainty in dose calculations, we will look at it afterwards, which will be the plan complexity.\", 'But now we are looking basically at the geometric uncertainty with the patient, patient setup the anatomical changes or movements and the density changes inside the patient.', 'And this is what we would call the robustness of the plan.', 'So, in a robust plan, the CTV will receive the prescribed dose and the normal tissues will fulfil the restrictions, despite all the uncertainties we have.', 'So, a good treatment plan should have a good dose distribution, but also it should be robust to this, potential differences on the day- to-day treatment on the patient.', 'How we can make a plan robust?', 'There is one method that we have been using for years, which is the margins.', 'So, we can use margins both in the clinical target volume.', \"And we drive the treatment-planning volume to be sure, that even the CTV moves within the PTV, as we are evaluating homogeneously, or we are ensuring that the PTV is radiated with the prescribed dose, it means that the CTV will receive the dose that's prescribed.\", 'And we also can do that with the organs at risk, and define the PRVs, the planning risk volume.', 'Anyway, we know that the Margin approach has several limitations.', \"One of the major limitations is that basically it assumes a static dose cloud calculation, and this means that it doesn't account, for instance, if there is any air on the rectum, which would modify the dose distribution, these dose distributions would not be modified, would had an impact on the coverage or those organs at risk that we wouldn't solve with this margin approaches.\", 'Another way to go on, is with a robust optimization and robust evaluation.', 'This is a modern approach where it is much more sophisticated and takes the uncertainties explicitly into account.', \"So, if they into, we look at different scenarios, so we have different presences, different cities, different communities, and then we take into consideration all these possibilities of that patient, that concrete patient, and this will solve, this solves the Margin approach, because basically we stop using Margins and we'll look at this probabilistic planning to make this plan robust.\", 'Another way for instance, interesting to make the plan for instance a breast plan robust, is the use of virtual bolus So we force the treatment planning system to deliver a homogeneous fluence outside the body to account for the fact that with the breathing, the patient will move the breasts, and we need this breast still to be inside the dose distribution.', 'This static dose distribution we are referring to.', 'By doing that, by doing VMAT with this virtual bolus we are ensuring that this plan will... the CTV will be cover, whatever the breathing place of the patient is.', 'This was done on 3D conformer.', \"So, if you are a studio in 3D conformer for the breast you know that usually you open the beam that it goes, it's not matching the surface of the CT of the breasts on the CT, but you open it a little bit more to account for that.\", 'And you have to take this also into account when you are doing VMAT planning.', 'This is some images on how you do that.', \"Let's move now to the plan complexity.\", 'And the plan complexity basically looks at the characteristics of the plan from a mechanical point of view that make the plan difficult to be deliver by the treatment machine.', 'And also put some challenges to the treatment planning system, calculation accuracy.', 'And basically, these are the aperture size and irregularity, and also the speed of the gantry and dose rate.', 'So why is this plan complexity important?', 'Because the calculation uncertainties will depend on plan complexity.', \"For instance, one thing that is a lot, well, for the physicists, but you know that the MSC, how they are built, they have what we call tongue-and-groove so that the lips move like this, and there is, in order to avoid having a leakage there's kind of a small step that makes the leaves move this way.\", \"So, and this small step that is made because we don't want to have leakage has to be modelled in the treatment planning system and for most planning system, the model of this phenomenon demency, it's not perfect.\", 'It means that we will have a lot of tongue-and-groove.', 'So, this small step going in and out of the beam.', 'This can impact our, dose calculation uncertainties so that dose calculations will be not as accurate as we think, also the small fields, present challenges in the dose calculation, and also then the delivery uncertainties.', 'So, the delivery uncertainties depend on the plan complexity.', 'And then the physicist commonly says, okay, I do quality verification.', 'So, what are you telling me, so I am getting excellent results with high complex plans, but anyway, reducing these uncertainties is still important because we want to deliver the desired dose distribution to the patient?', 'So having this under control is important.', \"So, let's get the best plan we can with the lower complexity and the higher robustness.\", \"So, and it's what I was telling.\", 'So, a highly complex plan involves smaller and more irregular MLC apertures larger tongue-and-groove effects, higher modulation of dynamic parameters, higher monitoring units and more intra fraction movements and interplay effects.', 'So, in summary, plans with low complexity have less uncertainties, and we have more accurate dose calculations in the treatment planning system, and better accuracy and robustness in treatment delivery.', 'So, this we could look at, for instance, this would be the plan quality, plan score on the plan irregularity.', 'We would think that, okay, increase the plan regularity, which is a complexity score, will means that we will have a better dose distribution, but you see that this is not the case.', 'So, this is different centres.', 'We deliver the same case, they use the same VMAT, the same TPS, similar linacs and you can see how different centres even having a very high plan score.', 'The plan is score is based on the dose distribution, on the achievement of the dose constraints.', 'And the dose objectives set by the radiation oncologist.', 'You can see that very high plan score.', 'They have a complete range of different plan irregularities, which is one of the complexity scores.', 'Okay?', 'So probably this are unnecessarily complex plans.', 'And these would be the optimal plans.', 'So, a low plan irregularity with a very high plan score regarding the achievement of dose constraints and dose objectives in the PTVs.', 'And this will be sub-optimal plans.', \"And these would be worse plans because they don't reach this plan score and they have somehow a high plane irregularity.\", 'So, in summary, treatment plan quality depends on the calculated dose distribution.', \"And remember, this is a nominal scenario, but it's not the dose that you will deliver to the patient.\", 'And here as a radiation oncologist.', 'You have to be very conscious that sometimes because you want to push down the dose to the rectum, then you will have a fluency.', 'We look at the plan slide by slide.', 'You may find that you have a very high dose, very near the rectum, because we are pushing the fluence out of the rectum.', 'The dose has to be somewhere.', 'And it means that this plan will be very...', \"The robustness will not be very good because if the rectum moves this 105% that you have been near the rectum, but you don't see in the dose-volume histogram, it may go down to the rectum on the 3rd/ 4th fraction.\", 'And robustness.', 'So, look at the geometric anatomic uncertainties and then the complexity, the uncertainties in the dose calculations, and emitted fluence and you have to have these three things on your mind when you are looking at one plan So how do I see a treatment plan, treatment planning in some years from now?', 'So basically, what I would like to see is that we have a patient data form, from the radiation oncologist, we would have for that patient, that particular patient, with that characteristics, a predictive model, so that we could have a personalized NTCP, that will drive us to a personalized, dose- volume histogram constraints.', 'Or I would rather look at kind of the dose distribution 3D kind of type of constraints.', 'And we could have some personalized optimization goals that then we can compare with the treatment planning.', 'And this basically has to go through, I would say, AI may help us, do that, but we have to be conscious of one thing.', 'So, when we work on the night, we can have the 3D, doses distribution, all the boxes, these type of approaches that have been done by the group of Marcel van Herk and Laura Cella.', \"But please keep in mind that one model doesn't last forever.\", 'So, you have to fit the model again and again, every time you are changing techniques, the patients also change, the basic characteristic change.', 'So, all these has to be fit to the model in order to get it retrain.', 'And with that, I would like to thank some of my colleagues that have helped me for many years on, on discussions on plan quality.', 'Victor, Jordi and Diego and I am open for any questions you may have.', 'Thank you for your attention.', 'So, thank you very much.', 'Thank you, Nuria, for this excellent talk, very inspiring, I would say.', 'And so, we will be more than happy of course, to receive your comments and questions.', 'So, I mean, feel free to do that.', \"So Nuria, I think I took some notes while you were talking, and there's some like several points that I would want to address.\", 'So, you nicely saw that, whenever evaluating the quality of a treatment plan, we need to deal with complexity, and complexity is one of the issue that you address, but it would say like generally speaking, the topic is complicated.', 'I would say and is articulated.', 'And sometimes we, as radiation oncology as clinician, tend to underestimate the different characteristics that we would need to focus on to be able to judge properly a treatment plan.', 'So, some of the topic that you address are quite important.', \"So, the let's say limitation of the DVH.\", \"So, let's say, let's focus on calculated dose distribution.\", \"We tend to focus on DVH, DVH has a limit, probably the surface histograms are, better, and probably to have a better anatomical let's say representation of the dose distribution, we need to go for dose maps.\", 'I would say.', 'Some of the points that you touch on are very important.', 'So, for example, the way we delineate an organ at risk is crucial.', 'Of course, there is no consensus.', 'There are some initiatives that are trying to reach a consensus.', 'Some are national, some are international.', \"And, but we really need to know when, whenever we, let's say also evaluated clinical result and comparing clinical results.\", 'And particularly when we compare toxicity of the treatment, sometimes we really are talking about different things because the organ at risk has been delineated in a different way.', \"And so sometimes it's hard to compare the results.\", \"So of course, an effort in terms of harmonization, I think it's very, it will be very important.\", 'Then the problem of end points, right?', 'Because whenever we use dose constraint or dose objectives, then we need to set up some endpoints.', 'And the priority of the endpoints could be different.', \"And it's normally it's chosen by the, the doctor, let's say the physician or by the clinician, or by the team treating the patient and not by the patient.\", 'And sometimes the endpoints could be very different depending on the patient you are treating, and this is not taking into account.', 'And the other point is the plan quality you get from a medical physicist depends probably on the number of iterations, right?', \"So, when you treated complexity, you say, you don't need to go for unnecessarily complicated and complex plan, you should stay on the optimal plan, but sometimes plans are kind of too, let say basic, right?\", \"You do some number of iterations, then you reach your objectives, but probably by doing more iteration, you could still go and reduce the, let's say the deep, I mean, I have a better DVH in that, so probably sometimes automation could help.\", 'So, I would maybe want to have your opinion on the end points, the problem of endpoints, the problem of our harmonisation of counters, but also the, probably the issue of automation and how to probably improve the way we plan.', 'Yeah, definitely.', 'So, we have gone through that.', 'So, we have this in our institution.', 'We have nine dosimetrists, and we are six physicists on radiation oncology, clinical physicist.', 'And basically, what we found for instance, in prostate and rectum, where we have gone through automation was that depending on who was taking the dosimetry basically the plan you were going through more iterations than somebody else.', 'So basically, you could improve, you could push that histogram.', 'So that, has been kind of standardized now with two things.', 'First, on being very insisting, a lot on the radiation oncologist on the contouring the rectum, we have a peer review session looking at the contours every morning on all the patients.', \"So, we have with some consensus, that's very important when you are also trying to automate treatment planning.\", 'So, you have to have things quite a standardized from also from the contouring point of view.', 'And then now with the automation, we have been enable first to, to kind of get a very good dose-volume histogram, regarding organs at risk without losing a coverage of our PTVs, but also keeping the complexity under some three scores.', \"So basically, when we don't when we were training our model, we have rapid plan.\", 'We were taking plans that we knew that the complexity scores were reasonable.', 'So, we were going through... we have an independent program because this, unfortunately, is not implemented in full, I would say in most, of the blind systems, by the way, we knew that dose treatment plans had gone through the metrics for plan complexity.', 'What is more difficult for us to do is looking at the plan robustness.', \"So, the plan robustness, is something that really, I think it's very... it's a clinical issue in something because the plan complexity are some metrics that physicist do, and we keep them under control, you know, Professor Franco.\", 'But the thing is that the, the plan robustness is something that the clinicians have to be used to look at the dose distribution.', \"If you're using kind of a coloured wash, put 100, 106 and look where this dose are.\", 'For instance, for a prostate, look if they are very near the rectum, because it means that probably the dose optimization has been pushed a lot to get the dose out of the rectum, but you have a dose distribution that is not very robust to the position of rectum.', 'If you have slight movement in these 105, 110 or seven can fall into the rectum.', 'The same for head and neck.', 'So, for head and neck is another good example.', 'So, you can, for instance, we can push the 40 Gy ISO line.', 'ISO dose, out of the spinal cord.', \"And I can make our next, dose-volumes histogram, because it's almost there, but it's not touching the spinal cord, but it's too near.\", \"So, to have this idea of that, you have some points that really, really, or for instance, you have some maximums near the spinal cord, that small movement means that you can't have the 107 inside something that has to be looked, and you can only see that by looking at the dose's distribution.\", \"And we still don't have the tools in the premium planning systems, but we will never have the tools if the professionals don't ask for them.\", \"That's my message.\", 'So basically, if we don\\'t go to the vendors and say, \" hey, I know, this role was planning.', 'I want also for, for photons.', 'I want to be sure that my plan is robust to movements.', 'I want to do provide basic planning importance also because this will...\"', 'I am a believer.', 'I would say that this will make a high impact for the patients, because the more robust is a plan, the most consistent is to have the treatment.', 'And then when we started looking at the toxicity, you have said there are several standardization of volumes, also look in at the, the robustness of the plan.', 'These two things are very important in order to fit, our predictive models and make them kind of meaningful.', 'Yeah, reliable.', 'Yeah.', 'This is what it is.', 'True, true.', 'And Nuria, do you think, you touched upon robustness.', 'Do you think that the new approaches that are now being used of like a daily re optimization that can be done, of course, with new machine MR-based, or cone beam CT-based, would change the approach, because like, theoretically, at least, I mean, the inter-fraction variation should be taken into account, then, of course, the intra fraction variation could still exist, need to be managed and mitigated, but you think it will change, or...', 'I think, I think, yes, the problem here, I am sure that for the patient, it would be better.', 'The problem here is that we are not there yet regarding how we estimate the dose that the patient receives when we are doing adaptive.', 'So basically, the dose accumulation in adaptive with the formations.', \"It's a very difficult and non-solved problem.\", 'You can imagine, for instance, a very clear example is a lung tumour, that is reducing its size.', 'So, you put that up at that point, but then you, you may have this, or, head and neck tumour, even better.', 'So, you have a head and neck tumour near the skin and the treatment is working and you get a reduction of this tumour.', 'So how will you accumulate the dose there?', 'Because the tumour is not there.', 'So how you, deform, these tissues to know which is, the real dose that has received.', \"So, it's a basic thing because the mass, the doses is joules per kilogram.\", 'And if the mass is not there, how do you solve this issue?', 'So, there are things have been discussed, but these dose accumulations, in order to make a, to tell the radiation oncologists this patient has received this dose, or this is the final dose-volume histogram is not that easy when we are doing adaptive, even though I am sure that for the patient is the best.', 'So, at maximum, I can tell you, okay, I am sure that it has not gone through this dose in the, into the rectum, but the concept that you have now with dose-volume histograms, of dose distributions has to be re-thought.', 'And still there a lot of discussions on going in the physics community, how to make these dose accumulations.', 'Yeah, more...', 'Accurate, meaningful.', 'So, we can look at that, I can do it, but think about it, if something disappears, how, how do you trace that dose?', 'Yeah.', \"If a voxel is there and now it's no more, they are, then how can we manage that?\", \"That's true.\", 'Nuria, We can...', \"I think we are about to close because we are a bit overtime, but maybe just the final consideration, if you want, we talk about plan quality and plan quality, I think it's just a small part of quality, in radiotherapy.\", 'And I mean, you know, I know that you, of course are an expert also in, assessing quality, generally speaking in radiotherapy, you want to make like a final remark about how quality is important to assess quality not only for plans, but I mean, in the general process of radiotherapy for, in general being able to deliver a good patient care in cancer care.', 'Oh, for sure.', 'So, basically what it has been shown, and we are aware of clinical trials that they have looked at.', 'That the quality in the complete process of radiotherapy has a huge impact on the patient outcomes.', 'So, all the small steps have to be under control in a way in order to achieve a good result.', 'And this can be achieved in all the team plays together.', 'So, all the specialties, radiation oncologists, medical physicists, RTTs.', 'I mean, its people are the administration to keep track on the timing of the patients.', 'So, you can have a perfect plan, but maybe the patient cannot start after two months.', 'So, what does it mean to have a perfect plan quality if the patient cannot start?', 'So, these small things of keeping this under control are still important.', 'And one good recommendation is never, to be afraid to go through a clinical audits from external people.', \"It is an excellent exercise, and it's something that will come in Europe by, by the new BSS.\", 'So how we can do clinical audits.', \"We can use this as an opportunity to improve all the patient outcomes, or we kind of use it as let's do something so that we can sign and we are with, within the law.\", \"And I would like to encourage people listening that it's an excellent opportunity to push the governments, to push the structures of societies to work on how to structure, this clinical audits in a minimal, meaningful way so that we can improve the quality of all treatments for all patients.\", 'Right.', 'Right.', \"That's a very good final message.\", 'So, thank you.', 'Thank you very much Nuria.', 'So, thank you again for the very insightful and interesting talk and very educational and thank you everyone for joining.', 'Thank you for inviting me.', 'It has been a pleasure.', 'Thank you everyone, have a good night.', 'Bye-bye.']\n",
            "['Hola a todos.', 'Es un placer estar aquí, y haber sido invitada por el profesor Franco, para compartir con ustedes mi experiencia en la evaluación de los planes de tratamiento en radioterapia.', 'Soy Nuria Jornet, soy Física Médica Consultora, Jefe Clínica de Física Radioterápica, en el Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, de Barcelona.', 'Y bien, los objetivos de aprendizaje de esta ponencia serán proporcionarles una visión general del proceso de tratamiento con radioterapia.', 'Analizaremos los diferentes ángulos de la calidad del plan de tratamiento, porque al final de esta sesión, me gustaría que pudieran hacer una evaluación crítica de la calidad del plan siempre que se enfrenten a un plan de tratamiento elaborado por el físico médico.', 'Y también, porque es muy importante si tienes que diseñar pautas de radioterapia para ensayos clínicos, y también para protocolos internos de tratamiento.', 'Entonces, ¿qué implica el tratamiento de radioterapia?', 'Básicamente, vamos a tener un paciente en nuestro departamento, y el radiooncólogo decidirá si se va a tratar, y en este caso, él prescribirá el tratamiento.', 'Luego se someterá a algunas pruebas de diagnóstico por la imagen, por lo general mediante TAC.', 'Y de esas imágenes el radiooncólogo delineará los volúmenes que quieren tratar y los volúmenes que quieren proteger.', 'Toda esta información irá al departamento de física, que trabajarán en sus ordenadores para elaborar un plan de tratamiento, para conseguir la prescripción de tratamiento del radiooncólogo.', 'Y aquí realizaremos la mayor parte de nuestra evaluación del plan.', 'No obstante, sabemos que este plan se administrará al paciente en diferentes fracciones.', 'El paciente acudirá, en distintos días, al tratamiento, al departamento de radioterapia, irá a la unidad de tratamiento, y nosotros le administraremos el tratamiento.', 'Entonces, lo que deberíamos preguntarnos es si este tratamiento que se está administrando, concuerda con el tratamiento que estaba planeado, y por lo tanto con la prescripción de tratamiento del radiooncólogo.', 'Así que, tras las bambalinas para que esto suceda, para que podamos tener un tratamiento, que es el que el radiooncólogo prescribió, nosotros estamos haciendo, los físicos, básicamente estamos haciendo control de calidad de las máquinas para garantizar que todo funciona bien.', 'También estamos haciendo control de calidad del sistema de planificación del tratamiento; tenemos una prueba estándar para eso.', 'Pero luego tenemos al paciente, las imágenes, la planificación del tratamiento.', 'Y esta parte de aquí, incluso si tenemos esto bajo control, sabemos que el paciente también puede cambiar algo en el tratamiento, por ejemplo, o que la máquina, el día del tratamiento, puede no estar funcionando tan bien con nuestras pruebas de control de calidad.', 'Entonces, ¿qué es la calidad del plan?', 'De hecho, la calidad del plan es la adecuación clínica de la distribución de la dosis administrada que se puede esperar de manera realista de un plan de tratamiento.', 'Entonces, calcularemos la dosis en las imágenes del paciente.', 'Y luego tendremos una evaluación de la dosis administrada, teniendo en cuenta la prescripción, y también el volumen que ha sido delineado por el paciente.', 'He dicho aquí «esperada de manera realista», y es básicamente porque, tenemos que tener en cuenta las incertidumbres a las que nos enfrentamos cuando calculamos la distribución de la dosis, pero también cuando administramos la distribución de la dosis a un paciente en particular, diferentes fracciones.', 'Entonces, ¿cuáles son las aportaciones de las que proceden estas incertidumbres?', 'Básicamente, tenemos diferentes aportaciones, tenemos aportaciones que pertenecen al propio sistema de planificación de tratamientos.', 'Tenemos lo que llamamos el modelo de Haz.', 'Además, tenemos cómo se calcula esta dosis dentro del paciente de tratamiento.', 'También tenemos el modelo de Paciente.', 'Por lo tanto, suponemos que el paciente, cuando tenemos las imágenes de TAC y conocemos las densidades, y usaremos esto combinado con esto para obtener la distribución final de la dosis.', 'Y luego tenemos el plan de tratamiento.', 'Por lo tanto, esto nos proporcionará la distribución de la dosis según sea evaluada y aprobada por el radiooncólogo.', 'Por otro lado, tenemos el tratamiento.', 'Y en el tratamiento, tenemos que considerar que tenemos el LINAC, o la unidad de tratamiento.', 'Tenemos al paciente, el paciente real que viene para ser tratado.', 'Y luego tenemos el plan de tratamiento.', 'Y esto dará la distribución de la dosis administrada.', 'De nuevo, si queremos evaluar la distribución de la dosis administrada, tendremos que medirla de alguna manera, así que aquí tendremos también algunas incertidumbres.', 'Y compararemos estas dos cosas.', 'Y comparando estas dos cosas, diremos: «Bueno, el tratamiento se administró como estaba previsto, y como estaba prescrito».', 'Como pueden ver, todo esto es muy complejo, y por lo tanto tenemos muchas incertidumbres que debemos tener en cuenta.', 'La base de esta ponencia se encuentra en este artículo.', 'Hubo un taller organizado por el Comité de Física en ESTRO, para debatir entre los expertos, qué era la calidad del plan en radioterapia, y también cómo deberíamos evaluar la calidad del plan, qué parámetros deberíamos usar.', 'E introducimos, verán, que la calidad del plan no solo depende de la distribución de dosis calculada, sino que también, tenemos que tener en cuenta la robustez y también la complejidad del plan.', 'Y lo que haremos durante esta ponencia es fijarnos en estos tres componentes y entender mejor qué significan.', 'Por lo tanto, el mensaje importante aquí es que la calidad del plan no tiene que ver solo con la distribución de la dosis planificada.', 'Básicamente, hay que verlo desde diferentes ángulos para tener una idea completa de cómo se administrará el plan al final.', 'Así que, de nuevo, si vemos el plan de tratamiento, tenemos al paciente aquí, verán que este paciente tiene un poco de sobrepeso, eso es una cosa que hay que ver, porque el paciente de la sesión viene de manera diferente.', 'Esto es algo que puede suceder.', 'Pero de todos modos, tienen al paciente, pasarán por la TAC de planificación, tendrán el modelo del paciente, el radiooncólogo diseñará los volúmenes, prescribirá la dosis.', 'Y luego continuaremos con la planificación del tratamiento.', 'Y le proporcionaremos a radiooncología una distribución de la dosis, que se verá enormemente afectada por la exactitud de nuestros algoritmos de cálculo de la dosis.', 'Esto es algo que los físicos saben, y los radiooncólogos confían, a lo que se aferran, porque confían en nosotros, en que es exacto.', 'Pero hay diferentes incertidumbres.', 'Luego transferiremos todos los datos a nuestra unidad de tratamiento y el paciente acudirá para la administración del tratamiento.', 'Y pueden ver que el paciente viene varias veces.', 'Entonces, tenemos que tener en cuenta la administrabilidad del plan, lo que significa, ¿este plan que elaboramos en nuestro sistema de planificación del tratamiento, está siendo bien administrado por nuestra unidad de tratamiento?', '¿Puede la unidad de tratamiento tener algunas limitaciones que significan que este plan no se administra exactamente como lo pensamos?', 'Velocidades del túnel, velocidades del multiláminas, este tipo de cosas.', 'Y también, debemos tener en cuenta eso muy bien porque hoy en día todos estamos haciendo estudios de imagen a bordo, o la mayoría de nosotros, sabemos que el paciente puede cambiar de una fracción a la otra.', 'Por lo tanto, tenemos que tener en cuenta también la irradiación del paciente, y para hacerlo, tenemos que garantizar que este plan es robusto.', 'Por lo tanto, tiene que ser robusto para las variaciones de los pacientes, y también para la administración del tratamiento.', 'Y esto es muy popular ahora con los protones, porque tenemos, sabemos que el rango se ve muy afectado por las variaciones del paciente.', 'Y todo el mundo escucha o ve en las publicaciones sobre la robustez planificada, pero es un concepto que puede ser... también se debe aplicar a nuestros tratamientos estándar utilizando protones o electrones.', 'Recuerden que pueden enviar preguntas al chat, y el profesor Franco se encargará de ellas.', 'Así que empecemos, empecemos con la distribución de la dosis calculada.', 'Es lo que normalmente usamos para evaluar un plan.', 'Veamos este caso.', 'Por lo general, lo que hacemos es ir corte por corte, o esto es lo que deberíamos hacer.', 'Nos fijamos en la distribución de las dosis.', 'Este sería el mejor método de evaluación, ver la distribución de la dosis, pero hay que tener mucho cuidado con cómo, usamos las diferentes líneas de isodosis o las diferentes herramientas que tiene el sistema de planificación del tratamiento para mostrar que esta distribución es corte por corte.', 'Aquí pueden ver, por ejemplo, todas las curvas de isodosis.', 'Se puede usar el relleno de color con diferentes etiquetas, pero hay otras cosas que se pueden ver.', 'Se pueden ver los perfiles a través de diferentes estructuras.', 'Se pueden ver las dosis puntuales, las superficies de isodosis, etc. pero es importante tener cuidado con la visualización, por ejemplo, algunos de nuestros, cuando el dosimetrista llega a nuestro departamento y vienen de otro departamento, a veces solo resaltan línea de isodosis del 95%, 105% y algo así como 107%, pero faltan todas los demás.', 'Entonces, es algo que deberíamos considerar.', 'Así que tengan cuidado cuando vean esto.', 'De nuevo, si siguen este camino, miran todos estos cortes, obtienen la distribución de dosis 3D, pueden tener muchos cortes, tienen muchos vóxeles.', 'Tienes una gran cantidad de información.', 'Existe una relación compleja entre dosis-anatomía y respuesta clínica.', 'Es muy difícil de cuantificar, tan difícil de evaluar el impacto clínico.', 'Así que tendrán una idea de cómo es esta distribución, pero normalmente lo que hacen los oncólogos tradicionales, es mirar los histogramas de dosis-volumen que es una especie de resumen, o compacta toda esta información en un histograma, el número de cajas, prescriben una determinada dosis.', 'Y esto es lo que habitualmente haríamos, lo que el radiooncólogo miraría, y es lo que usamos para optimizar el plan de tratamiento, hoy en día.', 'Hablemos un poco de los histogramas de dosis-volumen, que es lo que llamo el Santo Grial.', 'Y me gustaría ser de alguna manera crítica con ellos, al menos para hacerles pensar lo que realmente representan y lo que realmente no representan.', '¿Por qué usamos histogramas de dosis-volumen?', 'Usamos histogramas de dosis-volumen porque hace muchos años, nosotros...', 'Hubo una publicación en el Red Journal de QUANTEC, donde la toxicidad de nuestros tratamientos se correlacionaba con estos, algunos puntos en el histograma de dosis-volumen.', 'Este es el caso de la próstata, y pueden ver que compactaron, reunieron información de diferentes grupos, que trataban la próstata, y buscaron los límites de dosis para toxicidad rectal grado 2.', 'Y pueden ver, por ejemplo, estas líneas, que muestran que hay bastante acuerdo con todos los grupos que para dosis altas que tienen, por ejemplo, que el volumen que recibe el 70%...', '70 Gy debe ser menos del 20% del volumen, de lo contrario había un riesgo alto, de tener toxicidad rectal de grado dos.', 'Pero para esta publicación, la mayoría de los parámetros del modelo se basaron en pacientes tratados principalmente sin IMRT, o localización diaria, así que no están haciendo IGRT.', 'Y la mayoría de los estudios usaron fracciones de 1,8 o 2 Gy.', 'Entonces, a partir de estos estudios, y de nuevo, poniendo el ejemplo de la próstata y el recto, nosotros, la comunidad acordamos algunas restricciones en el histograma de dosis-volumen.', 'Y aquí pueden ver las restricciones del histograma de dosis-volumen para la toxicidad rectal, y hay diferentes puntos en ese histograma de dosis-volumen.', 'Esto fue revisado hace algunos años por Caroline Olsson, y en 2018 y se ve que también para, para tratamientos de cáncer de próstata, revisaron estas restricciones en el histograma de dosis-volumen y se incluyeron nuevas técnicas, con todos los casos que se incluyeron, cuando se usa IGRT.', 'Fue con dosis nominales máximas, un poco más altas, porque hemos ido aumentando la dosis en la próstata debido a los avances en tecnología, y con fracciones de dosis, de 1,8 a 3, así que aún sin incluir tratamientos de SBRT, tratamientos focales, o protones, y ven que esto ha sido revisado de vez en cuando.', 'Pero lo que es importante que entiendan es que este histograma de dosis-volumen, aunque es una herramienta muy buena porque compacta información, es una especie de red de seguridad, la usamos para optimización.', 'Los histogramas dosis-volumen pierden, información espacial.', 'Básicamente, si este es el recto, y tienen estos puntos de dosis altas aquí y ahí, o las tienen concentradas en una región, el histograma de dosis-volumen se verá exactamente igual, así que están perdiendo esta información espacial.', 'Y hay evidencias, evidencias antiguas, de que la distribución espacial de estas dosis altas realmente es importante.', 'Hay datos en animales de los estudios de Trott en 1995, que muestran que el daño de la radiación del colon en ratas depende del tamaño y la forma de la superficie irradiada.', 'En los datos en humanos, sin embargo, no se han recogido estas, digamos, distribuciones topográficas de dosis, básicamente porque ahora tenemos la potencia informática para, de alguna manera, almacenar todos estos datos, pero antes no la teníamos.', 'Otra cosa importante en el histograma de dosis-volumen, es que como normalmente usamos el porcentaje de volumen dependiendo del recto total que delimitamos, entonces el porcentaje de volumen cambiará, por lo que depende de cómo se normalice.', 'Entonces, es algo que uno tiene que considerar cuando se comparan estudios, uno tiene que ser muy cuidadoso de la tierra, por ejemplo, del recto que se está delimitando, de otra manera uno podría tener problemas, básicamente porque estaría comparando, con las recomendaciones sobre el volumen que recibe una determinada dosis, pero estaría con un tipo diferente de volumen porcentual.', 'Otra cosa en los histogramas de dosis-volumen, y por ejemplo, la vejiga y el recto es la pregunta de si podría ser más relevante un histograma de dosis-superficie que un histograma de volumen, y había bastante interés en esto hace muchos años, así que tenemos un puñado de publicaciones de físicos muy famosos que trabajaban en este tipo de histogramas de dosis-superficie de los años 2000-2005.', 'Pero en ese momento, la radioterapia conformada 3D era el tratamiento de referencia, y no encontraron muchas diferencias, mientras si comparaban las métricas del histograma de dosis-volumen en función de volúmenes o superficie, pero esto era porque básicamente en ese momento, usábamos este tipo de tratamientos, que empleaban un proceso de planificación de tratamiento basado en el tratamiento de cajas de cuatro campos.', 'Nuestra distribución de dosis era muy, muy similar y los histogramas de dosis-volumen, aunque perdieran, información espacial, descrita de forma similar, distribuciones de dosis que en el fondo eran muy, muy similares, había una correlación entre el histograma de dosis-volumen y la distribución de dosis en 3D porque estábamos haciendo más o menos lo mismo.', '¿Qué pasa ahora?', 'Ahora tenemos modulación, IMRT y VMAT, tenemos diferentes técnicas, y luego podemos tener dos histogramas que ocultan, distribuciones de dosis 3D completamente diferentes en el fondo.', 'Así que hice este ejercicio, esto es una próstata y jugué con ella.', 'Hice esta especie de rejilla aquí y todos estos histogramas de dosis-volumen, ellos, puedo comparar, los histogramas de dosis-volumen, pero lo que hay detrás de ellos es una distribución de dosis completamente diferente.', 'Por lo tanto, en este momento, esta buena correlación entre la métrica del histograma de dosis-volumen y la distribución de la dosis 3D ya no es verdad.', 'Así pues, el mensaje aquí, es básicamente que tal vez es el momento de pensar en mejores métricas para describir la distribución de la dosis de manera que podamos correlacionarlas mejor, la distribución de la dosis con la toxicidad.', 'Y solo para mostrarles una parte del trabajo que se está haciendo en este sentido, aquí pueden ver cómo estamos revisando de nuevo, estos histogramas de dosis-superficie, y no solo eso, sino también observando dónde se concentran estas dosis altas en la superficie del recto y viendo si esto se correlaciona con diferentes tipos de toxicidades.', 'En este estudio se encontraron relaciones significativas en el tenesmo rectal y la incontinencia fecal explicadas por las altas dosis en la parte central y superior del recto, y también las dificultades de vaciado que se explicaban por las extensiones longitudinales de las dosis intermedias.', 'Este es otro estudio de VoxTox en 2015 también, y aquí se fijan en la distribución de la dosis administrada haciendo el mismo ejercicio.', 'Es decir, mirando la distribución de estas dosis altas en la superficie rectal y correlacionándolas con la toxicidad que encontraron.', \"Otros estudios, que son muy potentes y están siendo realizados por colegas italianos, por Laura Cella y Marcel van Herk, en el Christie's en Manchester, realmente se están fijando en la distribución de las dosis con las cajas y buscando si las cajas con posición de dosis altas se correlacionan con la toxicidad, y lo han hecho para los tratamientos de corazón y pulmón, y esto está dando datos muy potentes para entender mejor dónde están los problemas, cuando miramos la toxicidad y no miramos solo un punto en el histograma de dosis-volumen.\", 'Entonces, y esto podría ser, cómo evaluamos la distribución de la dosis calculada, pero ahora hablemos un poco de la robustez.', 'Y la robustez está relacionada con la pregunta de si estamos seguros al 100% de que las métricas del histograma de dosis-volumen coinciden con lo que recibe el paciente.', 'Esto es otra cosa.', 'Básicamente, en todos los estudios que he mostrado, se fijaban en la distribución de la dosis en el plan, y se fijaban en la toxicidad, pero puede haber una brecha entre lo que pensamos, lo que planeamos, y lo que el paciente recibe.', 'Y ahora vamos a fijarnos en esto.', 'Y básicamente, este es el proceso en, con respecto a un control de calidad de un paciente específico, y ahora nos centraremos en esta parte aquí, así que en la IGRT.', 'Ahora tenemos una herramienta muy poderosa para verificar lo que estamos haciendo.', 'Una es la IGRT, es decir, tomar imágenes antes del tratamiento, durante el tratamiento con el paciente en la camilla, cada fracción.', 'Y también podemos incorporar aquí la dosimetría _in vivo_ midiendo o evaluando la dosis durante el tratamiento.', 'Esto es también del estudio VoxTox del que estábamos hablando, y aquí están nuestros 10 pacientes de próstata.', 'Y pueden ver que cada paciente tiene un color, y esta es la diferencia de dosis, ¿de acuerdo?, en Gy, respecto al volumen del recto para cada fracción diferente.', 'Y pueden ver que para el recto, pueden tener diferencias para un paciente de hasta el 20% de la dosis.', 'No, 20 Gy.', 'No, 20%...', 'Yo diría, porcentaje.', 'Pero bueno, se puede ver que para algunos pacientes va bastante bien, para los pacientes hay una diferencia.', 'Si miran la isolínea de 40 Gy, pueden ver que puede haber una diferencia en el volumen porcentual del 40%.', 'Entonces, en este asunto, aquí hay otro estudio también del 2010, y pueden ver cómo el recto cambia de una fracción a otra, y esto tiene un gran impacto para algunos pacientes en la distribución del histograma de dosis-volumen.', 'Estos grupos también vieron que las correlaciones con la hemorragia rectal y la proctitis se lograron, fueron más fuertes, si tenemos en cuenta la dosis administrada y no la dosis planeada, que es algo que si lo piensan, es bastante obvio porque es lo que el paciente ha recibido realmente.', 'La cosa es que deberíamos tratar de igualar lo más posible, la distribución de dosis que hemos planeado con la distribución de dosis que estamos administrando, o deberíamos calcular lo que el paciente ha recibido para usar esta información, para guiar los modelos de toxicidad, por ejemplo.', 'Y así es como podríamos actuar. Entonces, lo que les decía era que o bien calculamos las métricas de la dosis administrada, o tratamos de que la dosis administrada coincida lo más posible con la dosis planeada.', '¿Cómo podemos hacerlo?', 'Con las instrucciones del paciente, preparación...', 'De manera que haya mucha coherencia entre la planificación y la administración, usar la IGRT, orientación mediante imágenes con TAC de haz cónico o resonancia magnética, ver los registros sustitutos.', 'Entonces, esto es muy importante.', 'Entrenar a los técnicos de radioterapia en las unidades de tratamiento, cómo deberían ajustar y cómo deberían evaluar estas imágenes de IGRT, podemos adaptar, podemos rastrear, o podemos hacer planes robustos o probabilísticos.', 'Aquí tenemos un resumen de dónde estamos ahora.', 'Entonces, nos fijamos en la dosis administrada al paciente, y podemos tener estas incertidumbres, que tienen un impacto aquí.', 'Así, la incertidumbre en la «fluencia emitida», el linac o la incertidumbre en los cálculos de dosis, la analizaremos después, que será la complejidad del plan.', 'Pero ahora nos fijamos básicamente en la incertidumbre geométrica con el paciente, la configuración del paciente los cambios o movimientos anatómicos y los cambios de densidad en el interior del paciente.', 'Y esto es lo que llamaríamos la robustez del plan.', 'Así, en un plan robusto, el CTV recibirá la dosis prescrita y los tejidos normales cumplirán las restricciones, a pesar de todas las incertidumbres que tenemos.', 'Por lo tanto, un buen plan de tratamiento debe tener una buena distribución de la dosis, pero también debe ser robusto ante esto, posibles diferencias en el tratamiento cotidiano del paciente.', '¿Cómo podemos hacer robusto un plan?', 'Hay un método que hemos estado usando durante años, que son los márgenes.', 'Por lo tanto, podemos usar márgenes tanto en el volumen clínico de tratamiento.', 'Y dirigimos el volumen de planificación del tratamiento para asegurarnos, de que incluso el CTV se mueve dentro del PTV, ya que estamos evaluando de manera homogénea, o nos aseguramos de que el PTV sea irradiado con la dosis prescrita, lo que significa que el CTV recibirá la dosis prescrita.', 'Y también podemos hacerlo con los órganos en riesgo, y definir los PRV, el volumen de riesgo de la planificación.', 'De todos modos, sabemos que el enfoque de los márgenes tiene varias limitaciones.', 'Una de las principales limitaciones es que básicamente presupone un cálculo de nubes de dosis estática, y esto significa que no tiene en cuenta, por ejemplo, si hay aire en el recto, lo que modificaría la distribución de la dosis, estas distribuciones de la dosis no se modificarían, tendrían un impacto en la cobertura o los órganos en riesgo que no resolveríamos con este enfoque de los márgenes.', 'Otra forma de actuar es con una optimización robusta y una evaluación robusta.', 'Se trata de un enfoque moderno en el que es mucho más sofisticado y tiene en cuenta explícitamente las incertidumbres.', 'Así que si ellos en, miramos diferentes escenarios, así tenemos diferentes presencias, diferentes ciudades, diferentes comunidades, y luego tomamos en consideración todas estas posibilidades de ese paciente, ese paciente concreto, y esto resolverá, esto resuelve el enfoque de los márgenes, porque básicamente dejamos de usar márgenes y miramos esta planificación probabilística para hacer este plan robusto.', 'Otra forma, por ejemplo, interesante de hacer el plan, por ejemplo un plan de la mama robusto, es el uso del bolo virtual. Así que forzamos el sistema de planificación de tratamiento a administrar una fluencia homogénea fuera del cuerpo para tener en cuenta el hecho de que con la respiración, la paciente moverá las mamas, y necesitamos que esta mama esté aún dentro de la distribución de dosis.', 'Esta es la distribución estática de la dosis a la que nos referimos.', 'Haciendo eso, haciendo VMAT con este bolo virtual nos aseguramos de que este plan... Se cubrirá el CTV, sea cual sea el lugar de respiración de la paciente.', 'Esto se hizo en un conformador 3D.', 'Así, si uno está en un estudio en conformador 3D para la mama se sabe que normalmente se abre el haz que va, no coincide con la superficie de la TAC de las mamas en la TAC, pero lo abre un poco más para tener esto en cuenta.', 'Y también hay que tener esto en cuenta cuando se planifica el VMAT.', 'Estas son algunas imágenes de cómo hacerlo.', 'Pasemos ahora a la complejidad del plan.', 'Y la complejidad del plan básicamente se fija en las características del plan desde un punto de vista mecánico que hacen que el plan sea difícil de administrar por la máquina de tratamiento.', 'Y también supone ciertos desafíos para el sistema de planificación de tratamientos, la exactitud de cálculo.', 'Y básicamente, estos son el tamaño y la irregularidad de la abertura, y también la velocidad del tubo y la tasa de dosis.', '¿Por qué es importante la complejidad del plan?', 'Porque las incertidumbres de cálculo dependerán de la complejidad del plan.', 'Por ejemplo, una cosa que es mucho, bueno, para los físicos, pero saben que el MSC, cómo están construidos, tienen lo que llamamos lengua y surco de manera que los labios se mueven así, y hay, para evitar una fuga, hay una especie de pequeño escalón que hace que las láminas se muevan de esta forma.', 'Entonces, este pequeño escalón que se hace porque no queremos tener fugas tiene que ser modelado en el sistema de planificación del tratamiento y para la mayoría del sistema de planificación, el modelo de esta demencia de fenómeno , no es perfecto.', 'Significa que tendremos mucho machihembrado.', 'Entonces, este pequeño escalón entra y sale del haz.', 'Esto puede repercutir en nuestras incertidumbres del cálculo de la dosis, de modo que los cálculos de la dosis no sean tan exactos como pensamos, también los campos pequeños, presentan retos en el cálculo de la dosis y también las incertidumbres de la administración.', 'Así pues, las incertidumbres de la administración dependen de la complejidad del plan.', 'Y entonces el físico normalmente dice, bueno, hago verificación de la calidad.', 'Entonces, qué me están diciendo, o sea, estoy obteniendo resultados excelentes con planes complejos altos, pero de todos modos, reducir estas incertidumbres sigue siendo importante porque queremos administrar la distribución de la dosis deseada al paciente.', 'Así que tener esto bajo control es importante.', 'Entonces, consigamos el mejor plan que podamos con la menor complejidad y la mayor robustez.', 'Y es lo que estaba diciendo.', 'Por lo tanto, un plan muy complejo implica aberturas más pequeñas y más irregulares del MLC, mayores efectos de machihembrado, una mayor modulación de los parámetros dinámicos, mayores unidades de monitorización y más movimientos intrafracciones y efectos de interacción.', 'Así, en resumen, los planes con baja complejidad tienen menos incertidumbres, y tenemos cálculos de dosis más exactos en el sistema de planificación de tratamientos, y mejor exactitud y robustez en la administración del tratamiento.', 'Así que podríamos ver, por ejemplo, esto sería la calidad del plan, la puntuación del plan en la irregularidad del plan.', 'Pensaríamos que, de acuerdo, aumentar la regularidad del plan, que es una puntuación de complejidad, significará que tendremos una mejor distribución de la dosis, pero ya ven que no es este el caso.', 'Estos son diferentes centros.', 'Entregamos el mismo caso, usan el mismo VMAT, el mismo TPS, linacs similares y pueden ver cómo diferentes centros incluso tienen una puntuación de los planes muy alta.', 'La puntuación del plan se basa en la distribución de la dosis, en el logro de las restricciones de la dosis.', 'Y los objetivos de dosis establecidos por el radiooncólogo.', 'Pueden ver esa puntuación del plan muy alta.', 'Tienen una completa gama de diferentes irregularidades del plan, que es una de las puntuaciones de la complejidad.', '¿De acuerdo?', 'Así que probablemente estos sean planes innecesariamente complejos.', 'Y estos serían los planes óptimos.', 'Por lo tanto, una baja irregularidad del plan con una puntuación muy alta del plan en cuanto al logro de restricciones de dosis y objetivos de dosis en los PTV.', 'Y estos serán planes sub-óptimos.', 'Y estos serían los peores planes porque no alcanzan esta puntuación del plan y tienen de alguna manera una alta irregularidad del plan.', 'Por lo tanto, en resumen, la calidad del plan de tratamiento depende de la distribución de la dosis calculada.', 'Y recuerden, este es un escenario nominal, pero no es la dosis que le administrarán al paciente.', 'Y aquí como radiooncólogo.', 'Debe ser muy consciente de que, a veces, porque quiere empujar la dosis hacia el recto, entonces tendrá una fluencia.', 'Vemos el plan diapositiva por diapositiva.', 'Puede que note que tiene una dosis muy alta, muy cerca del recto, porque estamos expulsando la fluencia del recto.', 'La dosis debe estar en algún lugar.', 'Y significa que este plan será muy...', 'La robustez no será muy buena porque si el recto mueve este 105% que usted ha estado cerca del recto, pero usted no lo ve en el histograma de dosis-volumen, puede descender hasta el recto en la 3.ª/4.ª fracción.', 'Y robustez.', 'Así que, observen las incertidumbres anatómicas geométricas y luego la complejidad, las incertidumbres en los cálculos de dosis, y la fluencia emitida y deben tener estas tres cosas en mente cuando se fijan en un plan. Entonces, ¿cómo veo un plan de tratamiento, la planificación del tratamiento dentro de algunos años?', 'Básicamente, lo que me gustaría ver es que tenemos un formulario de datos de pacientes, del radiooncólogo, que tendríamos para ese paciente, ese paciente en particular, con esas características, un modelo predictivo, para tener un NTCP personalizado, que nos llevará a restricciones personalizadas en el histograma de dosis-volumen.', 'O preferiría fijarme en, digamos, el tipo de restricciones de la distribución de la dosis 3D.', 'Y podríamos tener algunos objetivos de optimización personalizados que luego podemos comparar con la planificación del tratamiento.', 'Y esto básicamente tiene que ir a través, yo diría, la IA puede ayudarnos, a hacerlo, pero tenemos que ser conscientes de una cosa.', 'Así, cuando trabajamos en la noche, podemos tener la distribución de la dosis 3D, todas las cajas, este tipo de enfoques que ha hecho el grupo de Marcel van Herk y Laura Cella.', 'Pero tengan en cuenta que un modelo no dura para siempre.', 'Así que hay que ajustar el modelo una y otra vez, cada vez que se cambian las técnicas, los pacientes también cambian, el cambio de las características básicas.', 'Todo esto tiene que ajustarse al modelo para que se vuelva a entrenar.', 'Y con eso, me gustaría dar las gracias a algunos de mis colegas que me han ayudado durante muchos años en las discusiones sobre la calidad del plan.', 'Víctor, Jordi y Diego, y yo estoy abierta a cualquier pregunta que puedan tener.', 'Gracias por su atención.', 'Muchas gracias.', 'Gracias, Nuria, por esta excelente charla, muy inspiradora, diría.', 'Y por lo tanto, estamos más que encantados, por supuesto, de recibir sus comentarios y preguntas.', 'Es decir, siéntanse libres de hacerlo.', 'Así que Nuria, creo que tomé algunas notas mientras hablaba, y hay varios puntos que me gustaría abordar.', 'Bien vieron que, cuando se evalúa la calidad de un plan de tratamiento, tenemos que lidiar con la complejidad, y la complejidad es uno de los temas que abordan, pero yo diría que en términos generales, el tema es complicado.', 'En mi opinión y es articulado.', 'Y a veces nosotros, como radiooncólogos, como médicos, tendemos a subestimar las diferentes características en las que deberíamos centrarnos para poder juzgar adecuadamente un plan de tratamiento.', 'Por lo tanto, algunos de los temas que abordan son bastante importantes.', 'Entonces, digamos limitación del HDV.', 'Entonces, digamos, centrémonos en la distribución de la dosis calculada.', 'Tendemos a centrarnos en el HDV, el HDV tiene un límite, probablemente los histogramas de superficie son mejores, y probablemente para tener una mejor representación, digamos, anatómica de la distribución de la dosis, tenemos que optar por mapas de dosis.', 'En mi opinión.', 'Algunos de los puntos que toca son muy importantes.', 'Así, por ejemplo, la manera en que delineamos un órgano en riesgo es crucial.', 'Por supuesto, no existe consenso.', 'Hay algunas iniciativas que están tratando de alcanzar un consenso.', 'Algunas son nacionales, otras internacionales.', 'Y, pero realmente necesitamos saber cuándo, siempre que, digamos también evaluamos los resultados clínicos y comparamos los resultados clínicos.', 'Y especialmente cuando comparamos la toxicidad del tratamiento, a veces realmente estamos hablando de cosas diferentes porque el órgano en riesgo ha sido delineado de una manera diferente.', 'Y a veces es difícil comparar los resultados.', 'Por supuesto, un esfuerzo en términos de armonización, creo que es muy, será muy importante.', 'Entonces el problema de los criterios de valoración, ¿verdad?', 'Porque siempre que usamos restricciones de la dosis u objetivos de dosis, tenemos que establecer algunos criterios de valoración.', 'Y la prioridad de los criterios de valoración podría ser diferente.', 'Y normalmente es elegida por el, el médico, el médico, digamos el médico, o por el médico, o por el equipo que trata al paciente y no por el paciente.', 'Y a veces los criterios de valoración pueden ser muy diferentes dependiendo del paciente que esté tratando, y esto no se tiene en cuenta.', 'Y el otro punto es que la calidad del plan que obtienes de un físico médico depende probablemente de la cantidad de iteraciones, ¿no?', 'Entonces, cuando habló de la complejidad, dice, no necesitas ir a planes innecesariamente complicados y complejos, deberías permanecer en el plan óptimo, pero a veces los planes son también, digamos básicos, ¿no?', 'Se hacen algunas iteraciones, y luego se alcanzan los objetivos, pero probablemente al hacer más iteración, aún se podría ir y reducir la, digamos la profundidad, es decir, tengo un mejor HDV ahí, así que probablemente a veces la automatización podría ayudar.', 'Es decir, quizás me gustaría tener su opinión sobre los criterios de valoración, el problema de los criterios de valoración, el problema de nuestra armonización de los contadores, pero también, probablemente, el problema de la automatización y cómo mejorar probablemente la forma en que hacemos los planes.', 'Sí, sin duda.', 'Es decir, hemos pasado por eso.', 'Tenemos esto en nuestra institución.', 'Tenemos nueve dosimetristas, y somos seis físicos en radiooncología, físicos clínicos.', 'Y básicamente, lo que encontramos, por ejemplo, en próstata y recto, donde hemos pasado por la automatización fue que dependiendo de quién tomaba la dosimetría básicamente el plan, pasabas por más iteraciones que otra persona.', 'Así que, básicamente, podías mejorar, podías empujar ese histograma.', 'Eso ha sido, digamos, estandarizado ahora con dos cosas.', 'En primer lugar, siendo muy, insistiendo mucho en el radiooncólogo sobre el contorneado del recto, tenemos una sesión de revisión por pares observando los contornos cada mañana en todos los pacientes.', 'Así que, hemos llegado a un cierto consenso, eso es muy importante cuando también se está tratando de automatizar la planificación del tratamiento.', 'Así que hay que tener las cosas bastante estandarizadas también desde el punto de vista del contorneado.', 'Y ahora, con la automatización, hemos podido, primero, digamos, obtener un buen histograma de dosis-volumen, en relación con órganos en riesgo sin perder la cobertura de nuestros PTV, pero manteniendo la complejidad en unas tres puntuaciones.', 'Básicamente, cuando no, cuando estábamos entrenando nuestro modelo, tenemos un plan rápido.', 'Tomábamos planes que sabíamos que las puntuaciones de complejidad eran razonables.', 'Así que, pasamos por... tenemos un programa independiente porque, lamentablemente, no está implementado por completo, diría que en la mayoría de los sistemas ciegos, por cierto, sabíamos que los planes de tratamiento de dosis habían pasado por las métricas para la complejidad del plan.', 'Lo que nos resulta más difícil es de hacer es fijarnos en la robustez del plan.', 'Entonces, la robustez del plan, es algo que realmente, creo que es muy... es un problema clínico de alguna manera porque la complejidad del plan son las métricas que hacen los físicos, y las mantenemos bajo control, ya sabe, profesor Franco.', 'Pero la cuestión es que la robustez del plan es algo que los médicos deben estar acostumbrados a fijarse en la distribución de la dosis.', 'Si está usando un digamos relleno de color, coloca 100, 106 y mira dónde está esta dosis.', 'Por ejemplo, para una próstata, mira si están muy cerca del recto, porque significa que probablemente la optimización de la dosis se ha empujado mucho para sacar la dosis del recto, pero usted tiene una distribución de la dosis que no es muy robusta respecto a la posición del recto.', 'Si hace un ligero movimiento de estos 105, 110 o 7 puede caer en el recto.', 'Lo mismo para la cabeza y el cuello.', 'Así, para la cabeza y el cuello es otro buen ejemplo.', 'De este modo, puede, por ejemplo, podemos empujar la isolínea de 40 Gy.', 'Isodosis, fuera de la médula espinal.', 'Y puedo hacer nuestro siguiente histograma de dosis-volumen, porque está casi ahí, pero no está tocando la médula espinal, pero está demasiado cerca.', 'Así que para tener esta idea de eso, tienes algunos puntos que realmente, realmente, o por ejemplo, tienes algunos máximos cerca de la médula espinal, ese pequeño movimiento significa que no puedes tener el 107 dentro de algo que tiene que ser visto, y solo puedes verlo mirando la distribución de la dosis.', 'Y todavía no tenemos las herramientas en los sistemas de planificación de primer nivel, pero nunca tendremos las herramientas si los profesionales no las piden.', 'Ese es mi mensaje.', 'Básicamente, si no vamos a los proveedores y les decimos: «Lo sé, este papel era la planificación.', 'Quiero también para, para fotones.', 'Quiero estar seguro de que mi plan es robusto ante los movimientos.', 'Quiero darle importancia a la planificación básica también porque esto...»', 'Tengo fe.', 'Yo diría que esto tendrá un gran impacto para los pacientes, porque cuanto más robusto sea un plan, más coherente será el tratamiento.', 'Y luego, cuando empezamos a analizar la toxicidad, dijo que hay varias estandarizaciones de volúmenes, mirando también la robustez del plan.', 'Estas dos cosas son muy importantes para ajustar, nuestros modelos predictivos y hacerlos significativos.', 'Sí, fiables.', 'Sí.', 'Esto es lo que es.', 'Cierto, cierto.', 'Y Nuria, ¿cree que?, ha hablado de la robustez', '¿Cree que los nuevos enfoques que se están utilizando ahora, como una reoptimización diaria que se puede hacer, por supuesto, con máquinas nuevas basadas en RM, o haz cónico basado en TAC, cambiaría el enfoque? Porque, al menos teóricamente, quiero decir, la variación entre fracciones se debería tener en cuenta, entonces, por supuesto, la variación intrafracciones podría seguir existiendo, aún necesita ser gestionada y mitigada, pero cree que cambiará, o...', 'Creo, creo, sí, que el problema aquí, estoy segura de que para el paciente, sería mejor.', 'El problema aquí es que todavía no hemos llegado a eso con respecto a cómo estimamos la dosis que el paciente recibe cuando hacemos adaptativos.', 'Básicamente, la acumulación de dosis en adaptativos con las formaciones.', 'Es un problema muy difícil y sin resolver.', 'Pueden imaginar, por ejemplo, un ejemplo muy claro es un tumor pulmonar, que está reduciendo su tamaño.', 'Entonces, lo pones arriba en ese punto, pero entonces, puedes tener esto, o, un tumor de cabeza y cuello, aún mejor.', 'Entonces, tienes un tumor de cabeza y cuello cerca de la piel y el tratamiento está funcionando y consigues una reducción de este tumor.', '¿Cómo acumularás la dosis ahí?', 'Porque el tumor no está ahí.', 'Así que cómo deformas estos tejidos para saber cuál es la dosis real que ha recibido.', 'Entonces, es algo básico porque la masa, las dosis es julios por kilogramo.', 'Y si la masa no está ahí, ¿cómo se resuelve este problema?', 'Hay cosas que se han debatido, pero estas acumulaciones de dosis, con el fin de hacer un, de decirle a los radiooncólogos que este paciente ha recibido esta dosis, o este es el histograma final de dosis-volumen no es tan fácil cuando estamos haciendo adaptativos, aunque estoy segura de que para el paciente es lo mejor.', 'Así que, como máximo, puedo decirles, bueno, estoy segura de que no ha pasado por esta dosis en el recto, pero el concepto que se tiene ahora con los histogramas de dosis-volumen, de distribuciones de dosis tiene que ser repensado.', 'Y todavía hay muchos debates en curso en la comunidad física, sobre cómo hacer estas acumulaciones de dosis.', 'Sí, más...', 'Exacto, significativo.', 'Entonces, podemos fijarnos en esto, puedo hacerlo, pero piénselo, si algo desaparece, ¿cómo, cómo rastreas esa dosis?', 'Sí.', 'Si un vóxel está ahí y ahora ya no está ahí, ¿entonces cómo podemos manejar esto?', 'Eso es cierto.', 'Nuria, podemos...', 'Creo que estamos a punto de cerrar porque estamos sobrepasando un poco el tiempo, pero tal vez solo la consideración final, si quiere, hemos hablado de la calidad del plan y la calidad del plan, creo que es solo una pequeña parte de la calidad, en radioterapia.', 'Y es decir, ya sabe, yo sé que usted, por supuesto, es una experta también en la evaluación de la calidad, hablando en general de radioterapia, quiere hacer una observación final acerca de cómo la calidad es importante, evaluar la calidad no solo de los planes, sino en el proceso general de radioterapia para, en general, poder brindar una buena atención al paciente en el tratamiento del cáncer.', 'Oh, seguro.', 'Es decir, básicamente lo que se ha demostrado, y somos conscientes de ensayos clínicos que lo han analizado.', 'Que la calidad en el proceso completo de radioterapia tiene un enorme impacto en los resultados de los pacientes.', 'Por lo tanto, todos los pasos pequeños deben estar bajo control de algún modo para poder lograr un buen resultado.', 'Y esto se puede lograr en todo el equipo, actuando juntos.', 'Así que, todas las especialidades, radiooncólogos, físicos médicos, técnicos de radioterapia.', 'Quiero decir, su gente son la administración para hacer un seguimiento de la coordinación de los pacientes.', 'Es decir, se puede tener un plan perfecto, pero tal vez el paciente no pueda empezar hasta pasados dos meses.', 'Entonces, ¿qué importa tener una calidad perfecta del plan si el paciente no puede empezar?', 'De modo que estas pequeñas cosas de mantener esto bajo control siguen siendo importantes.', 'Y una buena recomendación es nunca, tener miedo de pasar por auditorías clínicas por personas externas.', 'Es un ejercicio excelente, y es algo que llegará a Europa por la nueva BSS.', 'Entonces, cómo hacer auditorías clínicas.', 'Podemos usar esto como una oportunidad para mejorar todos los resultados de los pacientes, o podemos usarlo como hagamos algo que podamos firmar y estamos con, dentro de la ley.', 'Y me gustaría animar a los que nos escuchan que es una excelente oportunidad para presionar a los gobiernos, para presionar las estructuras de las sociedades para que trabajen en cómo estructurar, estas auditorías clínicas de una manera mínima y significativa para que podamos mejorar la calidad de todos los tratamientos para todos los pacientes.', 'Correcto.', 'Correcto.', 'Ese es un muy buen mensaje final.', 'Así que, gracias.', 'Muchas gracias, Nuria.', 'Así que, gracias de nuevo por la charla muy perspicaz e interesante y muy educativa y gracias a todos por unirse.', 'Gracias por invitarme.', 'Ha sido un placer.', 'Gracias a todos, que tengan una buena noche.', 'Adiós.']\n",

don't quite fit into anything that we see in our flowcharts or guidelines and you really just have to take the individual patient and their and their cancer into account\", \"ah for example i think one of the biggest areas for us are patients who have hormone receptor positive disease where we're really struggling with when to abandon endocrine therapy\", 'we now have a number of different options and patients who have upfront resistance to endocrine therapy can be a very difficult area for us to determine', 'of course financial toxicity is an issue for our patients worldwide', 'we have

specific data with which to support to support decision making\", 'Esperemos que lo hagamos en el futuro.', \"so let's start out and talk about immunotherapy\", 'we saw in the last year remarkable data with immunotherapy in both early and late stage hormone hormone receptor negative her two negative so-called triple negative breast cancer', 'now we had seen before data with atezolizumab that there was a small but statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and a big improvement in overall survival', 'this data which was presented last year from keynote three five five showed that the addition of pembrolizumab to a menu of chemotherapy agents in patients whose disease was pdl one positive using something called the combined positive score or cps improved overall survival', 'Previous data had shown a four point about a four point one month improvement in progression-free survival.', 'this almost seven month increase in overall survival was very encouraging', 'and you can see the curve separate over time but only thirty eight percent of patients benefit based on this combined positive score', 'so that remains a big issue for us', 'selecting the patients trying to decide which tumor source should we biopsy the metastatic tumor or should we use archival tumor tissue', 'ah in these studies a large number of patients had archival tumor that was used for determination of the combined positive score', 'now in this particular disease setting it may not matter as much because many of the patients were recurring within a year of their last treatment in the early stage setting', 'but it still ends up being an ongoing discussion point about which tumor we should use for testing', 'we prefer to use tumor from the metastatic setting if we can', 'but it if because of the need to get this as soon as you diagnose a patient we often will do the tumor testing on archival tissue while we get the biopsy to confirm metastatic disease', 'we also looked to see whether or not we could expand the number of patients who would benefit from immunotherapy', 'This data presented by Javier Cortez at San Antonio this year showed that indeed a CPS of 10 showed here.', 'this is the cutoff of the combined positive score of ten or more', \"here's ten or more twenty or more for both overall survival and progression-free survival was really the right cutoff\", 'and that establishes a cps of ten being the cutoff to determine benefit of adding pembrolizumab to this menu of chemotherapy', 'the chemotherapy choices included nab-paclitaxel paclitaxel or gemcitabine and carboplatin', \"some physicians might prefer using gemcarbo even in patients who haven't had a prior taxane because you don't have hair loss and you don't have the problem with neuropathy although you can have a problem over time with thrombocytopenia\", \"but indeed it turns out when you looked at additional subset analyses that patients who received taxanes may have done better than patients receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin although the trial wasn't powered to look at subsets\", 'so in general we choose a taxane partner if a patient is more than six months from their last exposure to a taxane in the early stage setting', 'Immuno-mediated adverse events are very important to consider.', 'you can see that any grade immune-mediated adverse events were increased by twenty', 'and this is where you had at least ten patients in either treatment group', \"The most common toxicities that we've seen involve the thyroid and actually skin is quite common in the early stage setting as well as in metastatic disease.\", 'Pero cualquier órgano puede ser afectado.', 'because the immune system is more suppressed in the metastatic setting than in the early stage setting my clinical experience is that we tend to see less of the organ toxicities', 'we see pneumonitis as you can see in colitis but hepatitis less common', 'we see a little bit less

twenty eight months longer than anything we've ever seen\", 'and so it brings up the question about whether or not this patient population really was biologically different and whether or not we

we'll talk about just a second\", 'um and then new directions in combination with immunotherapy that i think are very exciting as well', 'ah this trial with docetaxel podamab duraxican is now open and enrolling tropion breast o one in hormone receptor positive breast cancer and that trial in triple negative disease will open later this year', 'we only have data interestingly with data dxd and triple negative disease but we expect to see hormone receptor positive disease at ascos', \"this data was updated at san antonio in twenty twenty one and showed very nice response rates in this small number of patients and the patients who hadn't received a prior tropo isomerase one inhibitor based adc the response rate was over fifty\", 'but again this is just twenty seven patients', 'um and you can see that the responses were remarkably durable for this antibody drug conjugate', 'fascinating thing about this adc is that the drug to antibody ratio for trastuzumab-drug and sarsatuzumab is seven and a half to eight', 'Para este, son unos cuatro.', 'Pero la toxicidad es completamente diferente.', 'it seems very effective but there was a lot of nausea which we see with ah trastuzumab direct to cancer', 'so i think this is the toxin', 'but they saw a lot of stomatitis and ten percent of it was grade three', \"so we have no idea why that is since we don't see that with any other adcs that use derek's derek's tecan as the toxin\", \"her two low is a very exciting area and today it's become even more exciting\", 'ah this is a funny definition not clearly biologically relevant but it was still defined based on a early phase one study with trustees and um darucan', 'so her two low is a higher prevalence in hormone receptor positive disease than triple negative disease sixty five versus thirty seven', \"and it's defined as being one plus or two plus by immunohistochemistry for hr two and not amplified by in situ hybridization\", 'Así que se puede ver que esto también está dividido por luminal A, luminal B, HER2 enriquecido y basaloide.', \"and what you can see is that the i once you have i h c one and two plus right not amplified you're seeing a relatively less basal like compared to the i h c zero and you're seeing an expansion of luminal b i mean this is really where all of this group is\", 'so the majority of these patients have luminal a and b disease which is interesting because that of course is our hormone receptor positive cohort', 'um there are a number of ongoing trials', 'destiny brest six there are trials that are looking at compared to chemotherapy of physician choice', \"there is a dis-cetimab vedotin that's also looking at her two low disease that's targeted to her two\", 'but a destiny breast zero four which is a phase three trial that randomized patients who had centrally defined her two low metastatic breast cancer that capped the number of patients with triple negative disease', 'ah patients were randomized two to one to receive trastuzumab-doxorubicin or chemotherapy physician choice and the numbers are listed here', 'you can see the numbers of total patients in the trial three sixty versus one eighty', 'the primary endpoint was pfs secondary endpoint overall survival and of course response and duration of response', 'we participated in this trial which allowed patients who had received up to two prior lines of chemotherapy and had exhausted their endocrine therapy options', 'Hoy hubo un comunicado de prensa de AstraZeneca y Daiichi Sankyo, que colaboraron juntos en este medicamento, que tiene el nombre comercial de enherito. Y acabo de copiar y pegar el comunicado de prensa, así que tenemos un nombre comercial aquí.', 'but this showed that there was an improvement in not just progression-free but also overall survival', 'um and this shows you a statistically significant and of course they say clinically meaningful improvement in pfs and os in her two low disease metastatic disease in the first or second line i guess second or third line setting', 'so they say regardless of hormone receptor status', 'So they have must have seen this in both the triple negative and the hormone receptor positive groups.', \"so very very exciting data that we'll see at ascot this year but will change the way we treat patients with metastatic disease i think in the not too distant future depending on drug availability\", 'also highlight the fact that sars-cov-2 gotevitan was tested in hormone receptor positive metastatic disease with up to more lines of therapy', 'so you had to received at least two lines of chemotherapy and up to five', 'so more heavily pre-treated compared to chemotherapy physician choice', 'this data will be presented at asco but is not yet available to us but should be in the near future', 'Así que de nuevo, preguntas en cualquier momento que tenga comentarios.', \"i don't see anything in the comment box yet but please feel free to put comments into the q and a box and questions at any time\", 'so brain metastases are clearly an unmet clinical need', \"it's a frequent site of metastatic disease up to fifty percent of patients with metastatic her two positive disease up to fifty percent with metastatic triple negative disease and often a rapid leads to rapid death in triple negative breast cancer\", \"Um, and then in hormone receptor positive disease, we're seeing more brain metastases because our patients are living longer and we have better options for treatment.\", 'it appears to be increased in patients who have pica three c a mutations and in about a half patients who have germline brca mutations', 'it can be seen in patients sort of really painfully who have very well controlled systemic disease', 'we can see continued inexorable progression in the brain and then development of leptomeningial disease over time', 'and here you can see this enhancement of the leptomeninges as well in this patient', 'ah recurrence after radiation is common and radiation toxicity is limiting for patients', \"um and of course because of the brain brain barrier that we don't understand well there's limited exposure to cytotoxins\", 'and most trials up until very recently excluded patients with brain metastases', \"we saw even though we've markedly improved outcome for her two positive disease that even when we gave patients with residual disease tdm one the antibody drug conjugate versus trastuzumab and showed a big improvement in patients who at risk of distant recurrence that there was still a continued risk of cns disease that was unchanged\", 'so this shows you distant recurrence very much improved from the catharine trial with tdm one but no difference in the development of cns metastasis', \"so that's brought up a lot of interest in trying to understand how we could improve outcome\", 'there are a number of different chemotherapy combinations that have shown limited efficacy in patients with refractory brain metastases', 'ah but these are generally very short-lived with the exception of some small studies bevacizumab cisplatin and topoiside in thirty five patients for example', \"where we've seen more improvement is in her two targeted therapies not with these groups but we did see some responses\", 'We even see it with trastuzumab, m-tansine or TDM1, where there was a response rate in 10 patients of 30%.', 'And again, tiny numbers, but still encouraging.', \"um so let's talk about some of the data that we have\", 'ah so we looked at abemaciclib as a collaboration in patients who had brain metastasis with lily and sarah tellini published this data in twenty twenty showing really limited responses and in patients with brain metastases', 'we do see these longer survivals in patients who have hormone receptor positive disease', \"here's the hormone receptor positive her two negative cohort response rate of five point two percent just three patients out of fifty eight but the intracranial clinical benefit rate was twenty four\", \"so although they didn't meet their primary endpoint in the patients with hormone receptor positive disease who have brain metastasis we often do choose ebemacyclib as the cdk four six inhibitor partner to endocrine therapy\", 'they did see a lot of abemaciclib in the csf a fascinating evaluation where they looked at abemaciclib analytes', 'not so much response in her two positive disease and leptomeningeal disease', 'again they did see a response but it was very short-lived in these patients and there were only ten patients enrolled', 'um noratiband capecitabine has been studied in patients who had her two positive disease', 'and this data was published in the jco by rachel friedman', 'Y se puede ver que hubo una respuesta bastante buena, 49.', \"um and if you looked at the that's by looking at the volumetric response\", 'Si miras a la suma de los diámetros más largos, era de veinticuatro por ciento.', \"and so it's still pretty good compared to what we saw before\", 'nine responses and they tended to be more durable as long as patients were staying on therapy', \"unfortunately this combination causes a lot of diarrhea but it's still a treatment option although not without regulatory approval\", 'and then we saw this data which does have regulatory approval adding to catnip to trazuzumab and capcitibine in patients who had progressed on all available therapies', 'trastuzumab pertuzumab and trastuzumab emtansine', 'they saw an improvement in progression-free survival in the two hundred and ninety one patients with brain metastases', \"and this trial actually allowed patients to go on who had active brain mets that patients didn't need immediate treatment for\", 'Así que fue bastante alentador.', \"And here you can see that it wasn't just progression-free survival, but overall survival that was improved in patients with brain metastases.\", \"and i've given to catnib and to two patients now who've had progressive brain mets despite radiation and really who can't get more radiation\", \"one of the patients didn't have a good response but i suspect now that this was radiation necrosis that we didn't wasn't read properly you know we couldn't tell\", 'Pero la otra paciente, que tiene múltiples metástasis cerebrales císticas y básicamente habría ido a la hospicio de otra manera, se sometió a este régimen de triplete para que subiera y ahora todavía tiene una respuesta continua a la enfermedad ocho meses después de comenzar este tratamiento.', \"and it's really remarkable\", 'Cada resonancia magnética cerebral secuencial muestra respuesta a la terapia.', 'so very exciting', 'destiny brestow three also looked at patients who had brain metastases at baseline but they had to be controlled', 'Así que un poco diferente.', 'Estos datos fueron presentados por Sarah Hervitz en San Antonio este año.', 'and here it shows you history of brain mets or brain mets at baseline with data in that group', \"and it's interesting because this trial looked at trastuzumab-deruxtecan versus tdm one\", 'so tdxd versus tdm one and you can see that there was a marked improvement in median progression-free survival using tdxd and the twelve month pfs rate with a hazard ratio of point two five if you had brain mets at baseline', 'So it does look like there may be some effectiveness in that patient population.', \"It's being evaluated now.\", 'ah so that is an ongoing evaluation', 'Intracranial response rates are shown here in patients with brain mets.', 'so they actually looked to see if the brain had shrunk further', \"now you can't take away the long-term effects of radiation but still that dramatic improvement almost a doubling is pretty encouraging\", 'Um, this shows you the intracranial response, again, uh, using, uh, resist one.', 'and you can see how much better it is for tdm one versus cdx d', \"actually i wanted to bring up one thing that's important to think about in brain maps is that so people don't think that resist is maybe the best way or the volumetric response\", 'So Reno response criteria is a way of looking at the volumetric response.', 'um and it shows you how you use the target lesions with complete response partial response and stable disease', \"so it's actually very helpful to look at this and it includes the volumetric response which i think is really helpful\", 'Publicado en dos mil quince.', \"so again i see there's a couple of questions which we'll answer in just a moment because they're just about\", 'Um, I think this is a really important area preventing cognitive decline.', 'with radiation over time like over and over again stereotactic radiation whole brain', 'and they do get', 'Some of these patients just have horrible cognitive dysfunction that contributes to their death.', 'um memantine in a randomized phase three trial showed a significantly longer time to cognitive decline', \"um if you took the momantine during the whole brain radiation and most people continue it because it's very well tolerated and then altered radiation technique is the most recent attempt to reduce the long-term effects of radiation and this is called hippocampal avoidance and you add it to whole brain radiation therapy so you basically try and spare the hippocampus from radiation using intensity modulated radiation therapy\", \"and actually there was a significant reduction in risk of cognitive failure and less deterioration at four and six months in both executive function and then learning and memory and patients just did better at six months so that's now become a standard for whole brain radiation therapy at least at our institution\", 'and lastly leptomeningeal disease is just a horrible tax area for progression in breast cancer', \"ah it's it's been relatively uncommon until now so this is older data but i feel like we're seeing it much more frequently now\", 'you see it more in lobular histology and thirty five percent of patients with leptomeningeal disease have lobular histology as well as triple negative disease', \"and the life expectancy after diagnosis tends to be very short unless it's at the initial diagnosis of metastatic disease or patients could live much longer so diagnosis is generally by checking the c s f and we're looking at other ways to look at diagnosis diagnosis of lmd in patients who have

preliminary results and have had some issues with the company being bought by another company and developing drug', 'Pero esperamos que veamos esto en un ensayo clínico pronto.', 'and then my colleagues as well as others are looking at cell-free dna in the csf to characterize the immune environment and look at potential targets maybe for early detection as well', 'Así, la terapia de

tiny slide but from our asco guideline update basically the recommendation from all guidelines is that cdk four six inhibitors be used in the first line setting preferably in combination with an aromatase inhibitor unless a patient has already received an ai and developed metastatic disease in which case shown up here you would go to fulvestrant', 'but otherwise i think right now we want to save fulvestrant for the second line setting in combination with alpelisib or everolimus depending on the the pic three c a mutation status', 'and managing toxicity for those agents is another area

additional question about how to treat those patients\", \"um i'll skip through this one and just go to the metastatic her two positive disease where we've made a lot of progress as well with

de Simona.', 'the first one is in patients with leptomeningial disease hr positive her two negative would you recommend the cdk four inhibitor or chemotherapy', 'Y si es así, ¿tiene un régimen

patients i tend to treat them as if they don't have lmd and i will use usually those patients also have a disease in their cns proper\", 'Así que traté con radioterapia y luego los trataba como lo haría si no tuvieran LLD.', 'one of my patients actually lived almost five years initially presented bilateral lobular cancer left hemineglectal disease as well as a few brain metastases', \"and she was well for without ever recurrence of leptomeningeal disease and that didn't really show up again until much later in her disease course\", \"but for most patients this isn't the case and they're symptomatic\", 'and what i do is i initially treat with radiation and our radiation oncologists do that as well', 'unless you have disease that extends and you want to get an mri of the spine', 'so you look at the brain and then the spine', 'Si tienen enfermedad que es a lo largo del cerebro y la columna vertebral, no se puede radiar todo.', 'so then i treat with intrathecal therapy with methotrexate', 'and then for systemic chemotherapy we try and use the drugs that cross the blood-brain barrier', 'so cape citobine', \"etoposide isn't approved for breast cancer but one of my colleagues who's very interested in this has given a combination of cisplatin and etoposide with very nice results in a small number of patients\", 'it really depends on how chemotherapy responsive the cancer cells are that have invaded the leptomeninges and what the systemic disease looks like and how symptomatic the patient is', \"and how many lines they receive if it's the first relapse or not\", 'and always from simona do consider bone marrow invasion as visceral crisis and so recommend chemotherapy or acdc acdc forensics can be used in this setting in patient with luminal and metastatic breast cancer', 'so i i think that', \"it's an interesting question because most of our patients with bone metastases have bone marrow invasion\", 'so what i consider a visceral crisis is pancytopenia', 'so a patient comes in with platelets of sixty five', 'um that is visceral crisis and in fact in most of those patients if they really i mean one of my patients now who developed metastatic disease after multiple lines of endocrine therapy because she had local recurrences um and progressed on fulvestrant to an abamicyclin with pancytopenia', \"and it's interesting you can't really see the cancer all that well on imaging but her platelets dropped to sixty five thousand and you know she's got transfusion dependent anemia\", 'and in that case i really find that only

positive metastatic breast cancer with brain metastasis what do you recommend in a second line if trastuzumab is not approved or available', \"so indeed in this situation so if you have all of the drugs available to you we would use tocatnib capecitabine and trazodone in the second line setting because of the overall survival benefits seen in patients with brain metastases that's so striking\",

really hard for our patients who don't have full coverage\", 'Y si fideicomisarios, mi droga aún no está aprobada.', 'Tdm one actually has shown a benefit in brain metastases.', 'so you definitely see shrinkage', \"if it's a patient who has progressive brain mets in line two you could consider noratinib and capecitabine where there was data from the nalla trial showing some shrinkage\", 'i showed it in one of my summaries and as well as in the combination data where they saw longer disease control in patients with treated and controlled brain mets', 'um so that would be one option', \"but again i think that um even capecitabine with trazozumab is not an unreasonable option if a patient has already received tdm one and you don't have any of the other agents available\", \"Lepatanib also showed brain benefit in brain mets, but it's the weakest of our of our um uh oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors that block HER2 and EGFR.\", \"so i would use noradrenaline before lopatinib if i couldn't just dose reduce use the sort of dose escalation schedule and use the lowest dose possible to avoid a lot of diarrhea\", 'Y solo para añadir más sobre esto.', 'do you think that at least in her to positive disease given the benefit of these drugs would you change the recommendation not to screen for brain mets', 'or do you think we should revise our recommendation at least in her to positive disease', 'yeah you know i just brought this up we have some cases to present at a local conference and i the fellow who prepared them i said you know you really should ask this question because i think that people are are changing', \"although our guidelines still do not recommend doing screening brain imaging and the advanced breast cancer consensus group didn't recommend it there were a lot of people who voted for it\", 'so it was in no means a universal agreement', 'and i think that because we now have treatment and you know sometimes you see really bad disease where people have a lot of symptoms and you have to radiate a much bigger area', 'i think we are sort of shifting towards screening brain mris periodically', \"the question is we have no idea how frequently to do it and what to do and so we're a little bit still lost in that area\", 'i i do however think having seen some really significant cognitive dysfunction in patients over time then radiation necrosis which is a huge huge deal a huge area to manage', \"you know if we were just doing a talk on brain nets we'd talk about radiation necrosis too because that's a big area that keeps you awake at night\", 'but in those patients you know if we just radiated smaller areas maybe we would have less toxicity', \"so that's the i think the areas that we still need to answer but maybe we should be screening in some patients\", \"so i think there are no additional questions maybe just a comment because you just touched but baby i think it's important on parp inhibitors in in brca-mutated patients\", 'so maybe just some summary on the management of these women according to their sub-type because i think this is important as well', \"yeah i think that it is really important and i think that we it probably doesn't keep me awake as much at night because it's a small percentage of our population\", \"ah so i didn't include it there\", \"and of course there's limitate limits to what you can talk about\", \"but um if you know it's so important for patients to have germline brca testing\", \"and if you're going to do if a patient comes to you and they haven't had germline brackett testing you can do next next generation sequencing which you were going to do anyway for the cancer and you will get the mutation\", 'and then you can go back and do germline testing', 'so swab of the mucosa or if finances are still an ongoing issue you can treat them as brca positive because we have data suggesting that even for somatic mutations we see responses with parp inhibitors', 'and then i think another area that comes up is what about a patient has pal b two mutation', 'we see this in triple-negative disease as well as hormone receptor positive disease', 'and in that group of patients how would we you know decide about parp inhibitors', 'And we have seen that limited data, but really encouraging that these cancers also respond to PERP inhibition.', 'so i think that what i believe is that if you could give it we try and give it', \"you can get compassionate use from the companies that make parp inhibitors if there's no approval within your country for the drug largely not always but sometimes like if a patient has a pal b two mutation or a somatic mutation\", 'and then the other question is when should you give the parp inhibitor with the other treatment', \"and i think that for cdk four six inhibitors we believe that you should give them first before the parp inhibitor because we've seen these survival benefits\", 'so well tolerated in most patients', 'and then the parp inhibitor would be second line', \"in triple negative disease though we just don't have great options for patients who are pdl one negative which is the majority of our patients\", 'so if a patient could get a parp inhibitor first line i would choose that because i think that you know it just depends on how much disease they have and whether they have visceral crisis', \"but i also although again it's completely off label i would use a parp inhibitor as maintenance in patients after they got a response to chemotherapy if you have to start with chemo\", 'because i think the earlier you give the parp inhibitor the longer the patient will stay on and potentially those patients may have a benefit in survival in an unplanned subset analysis from the olympia trial', 'so i think here the the the scenario will become more and more complex because we will have adjuvant parp inhibitors is like the cdk four and six', 'so i think it will become more and more complicated and we are going to test more and more', 'Así que esta población de pacientes realmente aumenta con el tiempo.', 'Así que creo que tenemos que estar listos.', 'Yo soy.', 'we just have a patient who was on a trial and got a cdk four six inhibitor in the early stage setting', 'Y ella tiene palmo, así que se podría haber dado una CDK para seis en.', \"she didn't relapse on it\", 'it was after stopping', \"ah but she has

slides and put them on.\", 'Okay, great.', 'So, our topic today is \" Things about advanced breast cancer that keep us awake at night.\"', \"And indeed, there are many different topics that we could discuss here because I was thinking about it as I was finishing up my slides and thinking that there are so many things that can keep us awake taking care of our patients, but we're gonna focus on just a few of them.\", 'And also, we can talk about any others that come up.', 'Okay, my disclosures here.', 'Okay, so, what are we gonna talk about?', 'About advanced breast cancer.', 'So, treating metastatic triple-negative breast cancer is certainly one.', \"We'll talk about immunotherapy, toxicity.\", 'Why do so few benefit from this treatment and whether or not we could extend immunotherapy to the most common subset of metastatic breast cancer, hormone receptor-positive disease.', 'Antibody drug conjugates are a very exciting new way to deliver chemotherapy that seems to be more effective with reduced toxicity.', \"An exciting press release today, I'll share with you.\", 'Brain metastases continue to be a big topic for us in terms of challenges and management.', 'And then, sequencing therapy.', \"I'll show you some examples of sequencing, but it continues to be a challenge.\", 'And as new agents are being studied, we always have to figure out how to fit in those agents, how best to treat our patients.', 'And even if you have a nice flow chart about how to treat a patient, we have to individualise the therapy for the patient.', \"So, there may be situations that don't quite fit into anything that we see in our flow charts or guidelines and you really just have to take the individual patient and their cancer into account.\", \"For example, I think one of the biggest areas for us are patients who have hormone receptor-positive disease where we're really struggling with when to abandon endocrine therapy.\", 'We now have a number of different options and patients who have upfront resistance to endocrine therapy can be a very difficult area for us to determine.', 'Of course, financial toxicity is an issue for our patients worldwide.', 'We have different issues in the United States than other countries of the world with various insurance and Medicare.', \"But for all people in the world, the increase in cost of cancer care is a big topic including just even how to manage your life when you're needing to come in for appointments without even considering the cost of drugs and your own share of cost.\", \"Other topics for discussion that we don't have time for.\", 'I mentioned the rapidly progressive hormone receptor-positive disease.', 'When can we stop antibodies in patients with HER2-positive disease who seemed to be without disease or NED for a long time?', 'Is 5 years enough?', 'Should we continue for 10 years?', 'This is a huge problem in countries where the drugs are only approved during the combination with chemotherapy.', 'And also, an issue for all of us because we want to have this tiny group of patients be our patients who are cured of disease.', 'And then the question about when we can actually... will it work as well to restart therapy if the cancer grows again, is a big question.', 'The same is true for immunotherapy.', 'The duration of treatment.', 'And then, management of refractory ascites is a big issue for our patients.', 'Lobular cancer tends to be an area where we really have trouble managing the cancer and lobular cancer over the spectrum of disease is an increasing issue that thankfully has achieved some recognition.', 'And then, patients who have chest-wall disease that can be incredibly difficult to manage.', \"Again, I chose not to discuss those because we don't have specific data with which to support decision-making.\", 'Hopefully, we will in the future.', \"So, let's start out and talk about immunotherapy.\", 'We saw in the last year remarkable data with immunotherapy in both early and late-stage hormone receptor-negative, HER2- negative, so-called triple-negative breast cancer.', 'Now, we had seen before data with atezolizumab, there was a small but statistically significant improvement in progression-free survival and a big improvement in overall survival.', 'These data, which was presented last year from KEYNOTE-355 showed that the addition of pembrolizumab to a menu of chemotherapy agents in patients whose disease was PD-L1 positive using something called the combined positive score or CPS improved overall survival.', 'Previous data had shown about a 4.1 -month improvement in progression-free survival.', 'This almost 7-month increase in overall survival was very encouraging.', 'And you can see the curve separate over time, but only 38% of patients benefit based on this combined positive score.', 'So, that remains a big issue for us.', 'Selecting the patients, trying to decide which tumour source, should we biopsy the metastatic tumour or should we use archival tumour tissue?', 'In these studies, a large number of patients had archival tumour that was used for the determination of the combined positive score.', 'Now, in this particular disease setting, it may not matter as much because many of the patients were recurring within a year of their last treatment in the early-stage setting.', 'But it still ends up being an ongoing discussion point about which tumour we should use for testing.', 'We prefer to use tumour from the metastatic setting if we can.', \"But because of the need to get this as soon as you diagnose a patient, we often we'll do the tumour testing on archival tissue while we get the biopsy to confirm metastatic disease.\", 'We also look to see whether or not we could expand the number of patients who would benefit from immunotherapy.', 'These data presented by Javier Cortes at San Antonio this year showed that, indeed, a CPS of 10, showed here.', 'This is the cut-off of the combined positive score of 10 or more.', \"Here's 10 or more, 20 or more for both overall survival and progression-free survival was really the right cut-off.\", 'And that establishes a CPS of 10 being the cut-off to determine benefit of adding pembrolizumab to this menu of chemotherapy.', 'The chemotherapy choices included nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel or gemcitabine and carboplatin.', \"Some physicians might prefer using GemCarbo even in patients who haven't had a prior taxane because you don't have hair loss and you don't have the problem with neuropathy, although you can have a problem over time with thrombocytopenia.\", \"But indeed, it turns out when you look at additional subset analyses, the patients who receive taxanes may have done better than patients receiving gemcitabine and carboplatin, although, the trial wasn't powered to look at subsets.\", 'So, in general, we choose a taxane-partner if a patient is more 6 months from their last exposure to a taxane in the early-stage setting.', 'Immune- mediated adverse events are very important to consider.', 'You can see that any grade, immune-mediated adverse events were increased by 20%.', 'And this is where you had at least 10 patients in either treatment group.', \"The most common toxicities that we've seen involve the thyroid and actually, skin is quite common in the early-stage setting as well as in metastatic disease.\", 'But any organ can be affected.', 'Because the immune system is more suppressed in the metastatic setting than in the early-stage setting, my clinical experience is we tend to see less of the organ toxicities.', 'We see pneumonitis as you can see in colitis but hepatitis, less common.', 'We see a little bit less adrenal insufficiency.', 'Patients are receiving steroids so that we might not see it as well.', \"Also, the median survival for these patients, and It'll just go back to this slide.\", 'You can see that the median survival is still 23 months.', \"So, these patients aren't living a very long time still.\", \"So, it's still a big issue for us.\", 'But what I found is that you really need to be able to identify these immune toxicities early.', 'So, if a patient shows up with any kind of a funny symptom related to their treatment or unrelated, you have to think at immune toxicity.', \"We've seen even eosinophilic esophagitis as a toxicity and these toxicities can occur three months or more after the last dose of checkpoint inhibitor.\", 'So, I had one of the very first patients I treated with a checkpoint inhibitor got one dose on a clinical trial had progressive disease.', 'And three months later presented with life-threatening diarrhoea from colitis.', 'That was, of course, before we understood that we could identify it early.', 'So, definitely you want to be thinking immune toxicity with almost any side effect.', 'Now, I mentioned that Impassion-130 showed a benefit of atezolizumab added to nab-paclitaxel.', 'So, they used one chemotherapy partner.', 'And the difference here, you can see in medium progression-free survival was seen only in the patients who had PD-L1 immune cell positive disease.', 'They used an antibody SP142 and not a combined positive score.', 'The antibody with a combined positive score is 22C3.', \"I'll show you a little bit about that in just a moment.\", 'They did show an improvement in overall survival, initially, about 6.3 months.', 'But with longer term follow-up, the difference is very similar to that seen with pembrolizumab, as I just showed you with a 7-month improvement in overall survival.', \"As you can see, patients who didn't have a prior taxane seem to have a better hazard ratio for overall survival.\", 'Probably, just due to the development of resistance over time.', 'But it is remarkable to see this.', 'These are called landmark analyses where it goes from 22 to 36% at 3 years when you understand the median survival is still only about 2 years.', 'So, there is a subset of patients who really benefit tremendously from immunotherapy but in Impassion-130, only 40%, almost identical to KEYNOTE-355.', 'So, what happened with Impassion-130 is actually, I think, a really important lesson to all of us about statistical design.', \"It's not clear to me exactly even though I was on the steering committee why they had a hierarchical pre-specified statistical analysis plan.\", 'So, what they said was that you had to have a benefit in the intent-to-treat population for PFS and OS in order to look at the benefit in the subset of patients with PD-L1 positive disease.', 'So, they saw a benefit in PFS and intent-to-treat so, then they could go on to show that the benefit was only in the PD-L1 positive patients.', 'But for OS, as you might expect, there was no difference in patients in the intent-to-treat population because only 40% were PD-L1 positive.', 'So, this was a...', 'You can see the benefit, looks clinically very important, but it was not allowed by the statistical design to look at the overall survival in PD-L1 positive patients, so because of the intent-to-treat analysis.', 'So, they needed a confirmatory trial to have full approval.', \"And then next trial they did, Impassion-131, didn't show a benefit adding atezolizumab for very unclear reasons, since we saw these data very encouraging with pembrolizumab and encouraging data in the early-stage setting.\", 'So, that led to actually withdrawal of the US-accelerated approval of atezolizumab in the metastatic setting.', 'There is one ongoing study still looking at atezolizumab in the metastatic setting in a phase III trial and approval was not withdrawn in other countries because this was not a requirement.', 'It was from the USFDA but it, certainly, I think, has resulted in less use of atezolizumab in this setting.', 'I show you these data here from the different trial, is the Impassion-131, the negative trial.', 'This trial, as you can see, included almost the same number of patients.', 'And PD-L1 was positive in 45%.', 'Paclitaxel was the partner instead of nab-paclitaxel but we used steroids in the KEYNOTE-355 trial because of the nature of the chemotherapy.', 'There was a little less of the untreated patients de novo, but similar to KEYNOTE-355, prior taxanes, again, a little bit more and less in KEYNOTE-355.', \"It is possible that these differences, which we can't really understand, may have made the difference in not showing any benefit in PFS.\", 'Here, you can see the PFS was identical but there was no survival benefit either.', \"And the overall survival in the patient population who received paclitaxel alone was 28 months, longer than anything we've ever seen.\", 'So, it brings up the question about whether or not this patient population really was biologically different and whether or not we should be doing intrinsic subtyping to better understand chemotherapy benefit in these patients.', 'So, I just want to stop here and remind everybody that you can ask questions, comments anytime.', 'So, anything that pops up, just put something into the Q& A box.', 'Send your questions and comments.', \"We really want to hear from you and hear what you're thinking.\", \"And it doesn't have to be a question.\", 'It can be a comment.', 'So, I look forward to hearing from you.', \"Put them in as we're talking.\", 'So, what are the questions for metastatic use of checkpoint inhibitors?', 'Well, why is PD-L1 only important for metastatic disease?', 'We believe that this is due to immune suppression from burden of disease.', \"It's fascinating that we've shown that the benefit of checkpoint inhibitors is relatively greater in higher stage and node-positive disease in the early-stage setting where neoadjuvant pembrolizumab is now approved in the United States based on the results from KEYNOTE-522.\", 'So, we know that disease burden is associated with a lower chance of pathologic complete response and even in patients of a PCR, relatively slightly worse outcome.', \"So, could it be that it's the disease burden?\", \"And I suspect that what we're seeing here and there have been some very nice studies showing this with matched-samples is a reduction in expression of PD-L1 and more importantly, a reduction in tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes and increase in mutational complexity that increases chemotherapy resistance and a reduction in the host, the ability of the host to respond to the tumour immunologically.\", 'So, the tumour, actually, the more disease burden you have, the better able the tumour is to suppress the host immune response.', 'The best chemotherapy partner, we still...', \"I mentioned this already, we'd still choose nab-paclitaxel if we can as a chemotherapy partner and in patients who've had a taxane and have resistant disease, gemcitabine and carboplatin.\", \"We don't really know how long to continue the checkpoint inhibitor, so, we have patients who've had excellent response.\", 'And then, we stop the chemotherapy and we continue the checkpoint inhibitor.', 'KEYNOTE-355 stopped the pembrolizumab at 2 years, atezolizumab continued the checkpoint inhibitor.', \"So, we don't really know and we do know that you can have more immune toxicity the longer your exposure.\", 'And then, of course, so a few patients benefit relatively in a real-world population.', 'It might be only 30% or so.', 'We need to look at novel combinations and try and improve the effectiveness of checkpoint inhibitors.', \"And also, we're extending checkpoint inhibitors to other disease subsets like hormone receptor-positive disease.\", 'And the big question is which subsets should we include and how we should identify them?', \"I'm not sure that the randomised phase III trials are identifying the right population.\", \"So, we'll see.\", 'And then, there are many trials and the neoadjuvant, post-neoadjuvant and metastatic setting looking at checkpoint inhibitors in HER2-positive disease.', 'On the right, I show you that the tests that you do to determine PD-L1 positivity is really important, and that was an ongoing question as well.', 'Here, you can see that in the Impassion-130 trial, we were able to show that there was some overlap in positivity with SP142 and the CPS.', 'But I think on the other hand, there were a lot of patients who had disease only positive by SP142 or 22C3 using the CPS of 10 cut-off.', 'So, very interesting.', 'And I have now seen some patients who initially had an SP142 that was 0 and have a CPS of 50.', \"So, this is really a real issue, and I'm sure that we'll see the reverse as well.\", \"We just aren't doing SP142 now in the United States.\", 'There are many different studies that are looking at how to amplify the immune response.', \"I've just showed you a few here.\", 'Induction therapy to try and enhance the host immune response with the little chemo or radiation therapy.', \"There's an ongoing phase II trial looking at doxorubicin induction based on the higher response shown here with a tiny dose of doxorubicin induction and then nivolumab as a single agent.\", \"We're using induction in a BCRF, Breast Cancer Research Foundation-funded trial with a variety of different agents, a MEK inhibitor, the ADC sacituzumab govitecan and liposomal doxorubicin.\", 'We know it enhances the immune response in the neoadjuvant setting.', 'And then we combine it with the checkpoint inhibitor avelumab after a 2-week induction.', 'And Sara Tolaney and Ana Garrido-Castro are looking at sacituzumab either alone or in combination with pembrolizumab in the first-line setting in patients with metastatic triple-negative breast cancer as well as hormone receptor-positive disease.', 'It was interesting data at San Antonio looking at patients receiving immunotherapy combinations who have a high tumour mutational burden or hypermutated HER2-negative metastatic disease.', 'But most of these patients interestingly have lobular cancer.', 'So, again, really important to think about that.', 'There are studies going on looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors that may enhance the immune response and radiation therapy that I think will be very important for us in the future.', \"Here's an example of the pre-data.\", 'So, the supporting data about looking at a checkpoint inhibitor in hormone receptor-positive disease.', 'These were patients who had PD-L1 positive heavily pre-treated hormone receptor-positive disease where we gave pembrolizumab monotherapy to.', 'The overall response was 12%.', 'It was a small number of patients, only 25, but the responses were very durable in those that responded.', 'And you can see that here in this bar plot and then in the spaghetti plot here where you can see the patients who did have a response.', 'It really was quite durable.', \"So, I think it's really interesting.\", 'We combine the checkpoint inhibitors now with chemotherapy because we know that chemotherapy enhances the immune response.', 'So, this is the ongoing KEYNOTE-B49 trial, which I am the US PI for, and Peter Schmid is the European PI.', 'Patients can receive again a menu of chemotherapy including paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, liposomal doxorubicin or capecitabine along with pembrolizumab.', 'And then, to be eligible, the patients have to have PD-L1 positive disease.', \"So, hopefully this will get around the fact that they're not dividing the patient group up by biologic criteria such as patients who have more luminal B disease, more endocrine-resistant disease.\", 'And the CPS is one for the cut-offs.', 'So, we will need to look at a CPS of 10 or greater in the final analysis shown here.', \"So, this trial, of course, is accruing, although slowly, because the number of patients who are CPS-positive who have hormone receptor-positive disease are small and we haven't quite figured out exactly how to identify them.\", 'So, hopefully, this will improve over time.', 'Antibody drug conjugates are a really exciting new area.', 'The antibody drug conjugate sacituzumab govitecan is a Trop- 2 antibody with the active metabolite of irinotecan attached and with a high drug antibody ratio.', \"So, the toxin is SN-38, which is great because you're delivering the toxin directly to the cancer cell with an antibody drug conjugate.\", \"You also get something called a bystander effect which is really very cool, meaning that even tumours that don't express the target of your antibody may be killed.\", \"Some ADCs are better at bystander effect than others and we don't understand that well.\", \"We also don't understand the toxicity of ADCs.\", \"We can't really measure the toxin in the blood, but we still see toxin-related toxicities with all the newer generation ADCs much more than trastuzumab emtansine.\", 'For sacituzumab, we see more neutropenia.', 'About 50% of patients needed growth factors but almost no patients discontinued due to adverse events.', 'So, you can actually control pretty much all of the toxicity well and diarrhoea, you can manage pretty well.', '10% grade 3 but with anti-diarrheal agents and dose reduction, this is easy to control.', 'The first analysis of the ASCENT trial shown here showed an improvement in progression-free and overall survival that was statistically significant in heavily pre-treated patients with triple-negative disease.', 'So, very exciting data and this established sacituzumab as a new treatment option in the second or greater line for triple-negative breast cancer.', 'But, of course, patients still die of their cancer and as you can see here, the overall survival median was 12.1 months in these patients who the median number of prior lines of therapy was three to four.', 'So, what else can we do?', \"Well, we have other ADCs that we're evaluating and then, we can move these drugs, of course, into the early-stage setting.\", \"Datopotamab deruxtecan is a Trop-2 ADC that I'll show you in just a second.\", \"And then, ladiratuzumab vedotin is against LIV1A, that's the antibody, but the toxin results in some neuropathy.\", \"So, it's still being evaluated with different schedules.\", 'Trastuzumab deruxtecan, of course, is being evaluated in HER2-low disease.', \"Again, I'll comment on that in just a moment.\", \"And then there's a HER3 ADC that has breakthrough status from the USFDA for eGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer.\", \"There are a number of phase III trials we'll talk about just a second.\", 'And then, new directions in combination with immunotherapy that, I think, are very exciting as well.', 'This trial with datopotamab deruxtecan is now open and enrolling TROPION-Breast01 in hormone receptor-positive breast cancer and that trial in triple-negative disease will open later this year.', 'We only have data, interestingly, with Dato-Dxd in triple-negative disease but we expect to see hormone receptor-positive disease at ASCO.', \"These data was updated at San Antonio in 2021 and showed very nice response rates in this small number of patients and the patients who hadn't received a prior topoisomerase I inhibitor-based ADC, the response rate was over 50%.\", 'But again, this is just 27 patients.', 'And you can see that the responses were remarkably durable for this antibody drug conjugate.', 'Fascinating thing about this ADC is that the drug to antibody ratio for trastuzumab deruxtecan and sacituzumab is 7 1/ 2 to 8.', \"For this one, it's about 4.\", 'But the toxicity is completely different.', 'It seems very effective but there was a lot of nausea, which we see with trastuzumab deruxtecan.', 'So, I think this is the toxin.', 'But they saw a lot of stomatitis and 10% of it was grade 3.', \"So, we have no idea why that is since we don't see that with any other ADCs that use deruxtecan as the toxin.\", \"HER2-low is a very area and today, it's become even more exciting.\", 'This is a funny definition, not clearly a biologically relevant, but it was still defined based on a early phase I study with trastuzumab deruxtecan.', 'So, HER2-low has a higher prevalence in hormone receptor-positive disease than triple-negative disease, 65 versus 37%.', \"And it's defined as being 1+ or 2+ by immunohistochemistry for HER2-and not-amplified by in-situ hybridization.\", 'So, you can see that this is also divided by luminal a, luminal B, HER2-enriched, and basal-like.', \"And what you can see is that once you have IHC 1 and 2+ not-amplified, you're seeing relatively less basal-like compared to the IHC 0, and you're seeing an expansion of luminal B. I mean this is really where all of this group is.\", 'So, the majority of these patients have luminal A and B disease, which is interesting because that, of course, is a hormone receptor- positive cohort.', 'There are a number of ongoing trials.', 'DESTINY-Breast06, there are trials that are looking at compared to chemotherapy of physician choice.', \"There is a disitamab vedotin that's also looking in HER2-low disease that's targeted to HER2.\", 'But a DESTINY-Breast04, which is a phase III trial that randomised patients who had centrally defined HER2-low, a metastatic breast cancer that capped the number of patients with triple-negative disease.', 'Patients were randomised 2 to 1 to receive trastuzumab deruxtecan or chemotherapy of physician choice, and the numbers are listed here.', 'You can see the numbers of total patients in the trial, 360 versus 180.', 'The primary endpoint was PFS, secondary endpoint, overall survival, and, of course, response and duration of response.', 'We participated in this trial which allowed patients who had received up to two prior lines of chemotherapy and had exhausted their endocrine therapy options.', 'Today, there was a press release from AstraZeneca and Daiichi Sankyo, who collaborated together on this drug, which has the brand name of Enhertu and I just copied and pasted the press release, so, we have a brand name on here.', 'But this showed that there was an improvement in not just progression-free, but also overall survival.', 'And this shows you a statistically significant, and, of course, they say clinically meaningful, improvement in PFS and OS in HER2-low disease, metastatic disease in the first or second-line, I guess, second or third-line setting.', 'So, they say regardless of hormone receptor status.', 'So, they have must have seen this in both the triple-negative and the hormone receptor-positive groups.', \"So, very, very exciting data that we'll see at ASCO this year but will change the way we treat patients with metastatic disease, I think, in a not-too- distant future, depending on drug availability.\", 'I also highlight the fact that sacituzumab govitecan was tested in hormone receptor-positive metastatic disease with up to more lines of therapy.', 'So, you had to receive at least two lines of chemotherapy and up to five.', \"So, more heavily pre-treated compared to chemotherapy of physician's choice.\", 'These data will be presented at ASCO but is not yet available to us but should be in the near future.', 'So, again, questions, anytime, you have comments.', \"I don't see anything in the comment box yet but please feel free to put comments into the Q& A box and questions at any time.\", 'So, brain metastases are clearly an unmet clinical need.', \"It's a frequent site of metastatic disease, up to 50% of patients with metastatic HER2-positive disease, up to 50% with metastatic triple-negative disease and often leads to rapid death in triple-negative breast cancer.\", \"And then, in hormone receptor-positive disease, we're seeing more brain metastases because our patients are living longer and we have better options for treatment.\", 'It appears to be increased in patients who have PIK3CA mutations and in about a half patients who have germline BRCA mutations.', 'It can be seen in patients, sort of really painfully, who have very well-controlled systemic disease.', 'We can see continued inexorable progression in the brain and then, development of leptomeningeal disease over time.', 'And here you can see this enhancement of the leptomeninges as well in this patient.', 'Recurrence after radiation is common and radiation toxicity is limiting for patients.', \"And, of course, because of the blood- brain barrier that we don't understand well, there's limited exposure to cyto-toxics.\", 'And most trials, up until very recently, excluded patients with brain metastases.', 'We saw, even though we markedly improved outcome for HER2-positive disease that even when we gave patients with residual disease T-DM1 or the antibody drug conjugate versus trastuzumab and showed a big improvement in patients who are at risk of distant recurrence that there was still a continued risk of CNS disease that was unchanged.', 'So, this shows you distant recurrence very much improved from the KATHERINE trial with T-DM1 but no difference in the development of CNS metastases.', 'So, that brought up a lot of interest in trying to understand how we could improve outcome.', 'There are a number of different chemotherapy combinations that have shown limited efficacy in patients with refractory brain metastases.', 'But these are generally very short-lived with the exception of some small studies, bevacizumab, cisplatin, etoposide in 35 patients, for example.', \"Where we've seen more improvement is in HER2-targeted therapies, not with these groups but we did see some responses.\", 'We even see it with trastuzumab emtansine or T-DM1 where there was a response rate in 10 patients of 30%.', 'Again, tiny numbers but still encouraging.', \"So, let's talk about some of the data that we have.\", 'So, we looked at abemaciclib as a collaboration in patients who had brain metastases with Lilly and Sara Tolaney published these data in 2020 showing really limited responses in patients with brain metastasis.', 'We do see these longer survivals in patients who have hormone receptor-positive disease.', \"Here's the hormone receptor-positive HER2-negative cohort, response rate of 5.2%, just 3 patients out of 58 but the intracranial clinical benefit rate was 24%.\", \"So, although, they didn't meet their primary endpoint in the patients with hormone receptor-positive disease who have brain metastases, we often do choose abemaciclib as the CDK4/ 6 inhibitor partner to endocrine therapy.\", 'They did see a lot of a abemaciclib in the CSF, a fascinating evaluation, where they looked at a abemaciclib analytes.', 'Not so much response in HER2-positive disease and leptomeningeal disease.', 'Again, they did see a response but it was very short-lived in these patients, and there were only 10 patients enrolled.', 'Neratinib, capecitabine has been studied in patients who had HER2-positive disease.', 'And these data were published in the JCO by Rachel Freedman.', 'And you can see that there was actually a pretty good CNS response rate, 49%.', \"And if you looked at the... that's by looking at the volumetric response.\", 'If you looked at the sum of the longest diameters, it was 24%.', \"So, it's still pretty good compared to what we saw before.\", 'Nine responses, and they tended to be more durable as long as patients were staying on therapy.', \"Unfortunately, this combination causes a lot of diarrhoea but it's still a treatment option although not without regulatory approval.\", 'And then we saw these data, which does have regulatory approval adding tucatinib to trastuzumab and capecitabine in patients who have progressed on all available therapies.', 'Trastuzumab, pertuzumab and trastuzumab emtansine.', 'They saw an improvement in progression-free survival in the 291 patients with brain metastases.', \"And this trial actually allowed patients to go on, who had active brain mets, that patients didn't need immediate treatment for.\", 'So, it was quite encouraging.', \"And here, you can see that it wasn't just progression-free survival but overall survival that was improved in patients with brain metastases.\", \"And I've given tucatinib to two patients now who've had progressive brain mets despite radiation and really who can't get more radiation.\", \"One of the patients didn't have a good response but I suspect now that this was a radiation necrosis that we didn't, wasn't read prop., we couldn't tell.\", \"But the other patient who has multiple cystic brain metastases and basically would've gone on hospice otherwise went on this triplet regimen from HER2CLIMB and now, still has continuing response to disease 8 months after starting this therapy.\", \"And it's really remarkable.\", 'Each sequential brain MRI shows response to therapy.', 'So, very exciting.', 'DESTINY-Breast03 also looked at patients who had brain metastases at baseline but they had to be controlled.', 'So, a little bit different.', 'These data were presented by Sara Hurvitz at San Antonio this year.', 'And here it shows you history of brain mets or brain mets at baseline with data in that group.', \"And it's interesting because this trial looked at trastuzumab deruxtecan versus T-DM1.\", 'So, T-DXd versus T-DM1, and you can see that there was a marked improvement in medium progression-free survival using T-DXd and the 12-month PFS rate with a hazard ratio 0.25 if you had brain met at baseline.', 'So, it does look like there may be effectiveness in that patient population.', \"It's being evaluated now.\", 'So, that is an ongoing evaluation.', 'Intracranial response rates are shown here in patients with brain mets.', 'So, they actually look to see if the brain mets have shrunk further.', \"Now, you can't take away the long-term effects of radiation but still, that dramatic improvement, almost a doubling, is pretty encouraging.\", 'This shows you the intracranial response, again, using RECIST 1.1.', 'And you can see how much better it is for T-DM1 versus T-DXd.', \"Actually, I wanted to bring up one thing that's important to think about in brain mets is that people don't think that RECIST is maybe the best way or the volumetric response.\", 'So, RANO response criteria is a way of looking at the volumetric response.', 'And it shows you how you use the target lesions with complete response, partial response and stable disease.', \"So, it's actually very helpful to look at this and it includes the volumetric response, which I think is really helpful.\", 'Published in 2015.', \"So, again, I see there's a couple of questions, which we'll answer in just a moment because we're just about done.\", \"I think there's a really important area I think there's a really important area preventing cognitive decline.\", 'with radiation over time, like over and over again, stereotactic radiation whole brain. stereotactic radiation the whole brain.', 'And they do get...', 'Some of these patients just have horrible cognitive dysfunction that contributes to their death.', 'Memantine in a randomised phase III trial showed a significantly longer time to cognitive decline.', 'If you took the memantine during the whole brain radiation and most people continue it and then, altered radiation technique is the most recent attempt to reduce the long-term effects is the most recent attempt to reduce the long-term effects And, you add it to whole-brain radiation therapy, so, you basically try and spare the hippocampus so you basically try and spare the hippocampus from radiation using intensity-modulated radiation therapy.', 'And actually, there was a significant reduction in risk of cognitive failure and less deterioration at four and six months in both executive function and then learning in memory So, that has now become a standard for whole-brain radiation therapy for whole brain radiation therapy at least at our institution.', 'And lastly, leptomeningeal disease is just a horrible area for progression in breast cancer.', \"So, this is older data, So this is older data, but I feel like we're seeing it much more frequently now.\", 'You see it more in lobular histology and 35% of patients with leptomeningeal disease have lobular histology as well as triple-negative disease.', \"And the life expectancy after diagnosis tends to be very short unless it's at the initial diagnosis So, diagnosis is generally by checking the CSF So diagnosis is generally by checking the CSF and we're looking at other ways to look at diagnosis of LMD in patients who have symptoms in those cells using cell-free DNA.\", 'Treatment has been intrathecal with methotrexate but there are new directions being evaluated, kind of disappointing results from intrathecal trastuzumab.', 'And radiation is used for bulky lesions up front.', 'There are a number of different studies that are being, treatments that are evaluated.', 'I thought some of the most interesting ones were using IV or intrathecal pembrolizumab or nivolumab, which is really interesting.', \"And there's actually a case report from one of our senior fellows looking at giving intrathecal checkpoint inhibitor melanoma and showing this dramatic shrinkage in disease in a patient who had LMD.\", \"There's a really interesting drug, paclitaxel conjugated to Angiopep-2 that targets a receptor called LRP1 on the blood-brain barrier that's upregulated in brain tumours.\", 'And this targeting facilitates receptor-mediated transcytosis across the blood- brain barrier.', 'They have some really interesting preliminary results and have had some issues with the company being bought by another company and developing drug.', \"But hopefully, we'll see this in a clinical trial soon.\", 'And then my colleagues as well as others are looking at cell-free DNA and the CSF to characterise the immune in environment and look at potential targets maybe for early detection as well.', 'So, sequencing therapy.', \"I'll just show you this as we finish here.\", \"In PD-L1 positive disease, we're using pembrolizumab, chemotherapy choice based on the time from last therapy, PARP inhibitors in patients who have a germline BRCA mutations and maybe in those who have acquired somatic mutations in BRCA.\", \"BRCA wild-type, we really don't have great options other than chemotherapy and the antibody drug conjugate sacituzumab.\", \"Maybe we'll also have trastuzumab deruxtecan in the near future.\", 'And then, for high tumour mutational burden and high MSI, you can use is pembrolizumab based on our US approval.', \"It depends on where it's approved.\", 'And atezolizumab is still approved in many places in the world.', 'For hormone receptor-positive disease, this is kind of a tiny slide, but from our ASCO guideline update, basically, the recommendation from all guidelines is that CDK4/ 6 inhibitors be used in the first-line setting, preferably in combination with an aromatase inhibitor unless a patient has already received an AI and developed metastatic disease, in which case, shown up here, you would go to fulvestrant.', 'But otherwise, I think right now, we want to save fulvestrant for the second-line setting in combination with alpelisib or everolimus depending on the PIK3CA mutation status.', 'And managing toxicity for those agents is another area that keeps us awake at night.', 'And then, of course, you can use tamoxifen.', \"We don't know what CDK after CDK4/ 6 inhibitors do, and there's a lot of interest in that area as well, how to use endocrine therapy in the third-line setting.\", \"There's a whole bunch of work going on with oral selective oestrogen receptor downregulators and new endocrine therapies like androgen receptor modulators that I think will give us a lot more options in the future that we can then use in patients who received a CDK4/ 6 inhibitor in the adjuvant setting where we now will have an additional question about how to treat those patients.\", \"I'll skip through this one and just go to the metastatic HER2- positive disease where we made a lot of progress as well with trastuzumab deruxtecan as well as the tucatinib HER2CLIMB regimen, which really have changed our sequencing of therapy.\", \"And now, we're gonna have to think about trastuzumab deruxtecan in patients to have HER2-low disease as well.\", 'Lastly, financial toxicity is really a huge issue for our patients and it can result in treatment non-adherence or refusal.', 'People lose their jobs.', \"Also, they die earlier if they don't get therapy.\", 'And this is a huge issue.', \"We have patients who won't come in for their treatment because they can't have childcare or they can't afford their drugs.\", \"And that's a such a big issue, and there's a lot of attention on this worldwide.\", \"We certainly haven't fixed it because finances are an issue for patients in all areas of life.\", \"And I think it's just... addressing financial hardship is really important as we start treating patients with breast cancer.\", 'So, I will end here with just listing the other topics for discussion and turn over the podium to Olivia and show you the advanced breast cancer Consensus guideline in the last in-person meeting.', 'We will have a mini-meeting in November of this year in Lisbon and encourage you all to listen in or attend if you can.', 'Thank you, Hope.', 'Very comprehensive.', 'And yes, really very interesting, and also, a question- generating.', 'We have two questions from Simona.', 'The first one is, in patients with leptomeningeal disease HR-positive, HER2-negative, would you recommend the CDK4 inhibitor or chemotherapy?', 'And if yes, do you have a preferred regimen?', 'So, I think a lot of it depends on how much leptomeningeal disease they have.', 'So, some patients have no symptoms and they have some leptomeningeal thickening on imaging.', \"In those patients, I tend to treat them as if they don't have LMD and I will use... usually those patients also have disease in their CNS proper.\", \"So, I treat with radiation therapy and then I would treat them as I would if they didn't have LMD.\", 'One of my patients actually lived almost five years initially presented bilateral lobular cancer, leptomeningeal disease as well as a few brain metastases.', \"And she was well without ever recurrence of leptomeningeal disease and that didn't really show up again until much later in her disease course.\", \"But for most patients, this isn't the case and they're symptomatic.\", 'And what I do is I initially treat with radiation and our radiation oncologists do that as well.', 'Unless you have disease that extends and you wanna get an MRI of the spine.', 'So, you look at the brain and then the spine.', \"If they have disease that's throughout the brain and the spine, you can't radiate everything.\", 'So, then I treat with intrathecal therapy with methotrexate.', 'And then, for systemic chemotherapy, we try and use the drugs that cross the blood-brain barrier.', 'So, capecitabine.', \"Etoposide isn't approved for breast cancer but one of my colleagues who's very interested in this has given a combination of cisplatin and etoposide with very nice results in a small number of patients.\", 'It really depends on how chemotherapy responsive the cancer cells are that have invaded the leptomeninges and what the systemic disease looks like and how symptomatic the patient is.', \"And how many lines they receive, if it's the first relapse or not.\", 'And always from Simona, you consider bone marrow invasion as visceral crisis and so, recommend chemotherapy or a CDK4/ 6 can be used in the setting in patients with luminal and metastatic breast cancer?', 'So, I think that...', \"It's an interesting question because most of our patients with bone metastases have bone marrow invasion.\", 'So, what I consider a visceral crisis is pancytopenia.', 'So, a patient comes in with platelets of 65.', 'That is visceral crisis and in fact, in most of those patients, if they really, I mean, one of my patients now who developed metastatic disease after multiple lines of endocrine therapy because she had local recurrences and progressed on fulvestrant and abemaciclib with pancytopenia.', \"And it's interesting, you can't really see the cancer all that well on imaging but her platelets dropped to 65,000 and she's got transfusion-dependent anaemia.\", 'And in that case, I really find that only chemotherapy can turn that around.', \"And what I'll do is start at a very low-dose of taxane if I can.\", \"This patient refused the taxane, so I gave her capecitabine and I'm holding my breath to see if her count-cells come up.\", 'But I have given really low doses of taxane in the setting and had patients recover.', 'But then, what I do is I stop the chemo and not in this one patient I mentioned.', \"She's got endocrine-resistant disease.\", \"But in other patients if that's a patient who still has endocrine sensitivity, I would start endocrine therapy after I get the counts to normalise and try and use it as a chemotherapy holiday.\", \"Yeah, I think a colleague of mine has a patient who is responding very well to metronomic chemotherapy, which means capecitabine and because she didn't want to have a full dose.\", \"So, I think it's, in general, is a very difficult situation to manage.\", 'They develop very quickly and they progress very quickly.', 'So, I think we have still a couple of minutes for questions.', 'And just for...', \"There's one in chat.\", 'A new one came in the chat, Olivia.', 'Ah, one in, okay.', 'Elena, yes, sorry.', 'For HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer with brain metastasis, what do you recommend in second-line if trastuzumab deruxtecan is not approved or available?', \"So, indeed, in this situation, so, if you have all of the drugs available to you, we would use tucatinib, capecitabine and trastuzumab in the second-line setting because of the overall survival benefits seen in patients with brain metastases that's so striking.\", 'I think that T-DXd if you had it would not be an unreasonable choice, but I think most of us would use tucatinib in that setting.', \"And if there's a one tiny brain met that's progressing, it doesn't matter so much.\", \"If there's a whole host of them and you need to give whole- brain radiation or they have already gotten radiation with some minor progression, tucatinib HER2CLIMB regimen would be, are considered.\", \"Now let's say you don't have either of these really expensive new drugs and tucatinib is quite expensive even though it's a pill, and really hard for our patients who don't have full coverage.\", \"And if trastuzumab deruxtecan isn't approved.\", 'T-DM1 actually has shown benefit in brain metastasis.', 'So, you definitely see shrinkage.', \"If it's a patient who has progressive brain mets in line-two, you could consider neratinib and capecitabine where there was data from the NALA Trial showing some shrinkage.\", 'I showed it IN one of my summaries and as well as in the combination data where they saw longer disease control in patients with treated and controlled brain mets.', 'So, that would be one option.', \"But again, I think that even capecitabine with trastuzumab is not an unreasonable option if a patient has already received T-DM1 and you don't have any of the other agents available.\", \"Lapatinib also showed benefit in brain mets but it's the weakest of our oral tyrosine kinase inhibitors that block HER2-and eGFR.\", \"So, I would use neratinib before lapatinib, if I couldn't, just dose reduce, use sort dose escalation schedule and use the lowest dose possible to avoid a lot of diarrhoea.\", 'And just to add on this.', 'Do you think that at least in HER2-positive disease, given the benefit of these drugs, would you change the recommendation not to screen for brain mets?', 'Or do you think we should revise our recommendation, at least in HER2-positive disease?', 'Yeah, you know I just brought this up where we have some cases to present at a local conference and the fellow who prepared them, I said, \" You know, you really should ask this question because I think that people are changing.\"', \"Although, our guidelines still do not recommend doing screening brain imaging and the advanced breast cancer Consensus group didn't recommend it, there were a lot of people who voted for it.\", 'So, it was in no-means a universal agreement.', 'And I think that because we now have treatment and that sometimes you see really bad disease where people have a lot of symptoms and you have to radiate a much bigger area.', 'I think we are sort of shifting towards screening brain MRIs periodically.', \"The question is we have no idea how frequently to do it and what to do and so we're a little bit still lost in that area.\", 'I do however think having seen some really significant cognitive dysfunction in patients over time then radiation necrosis, which is a huge, huge deal, a huge area to manage.', \"If we were just doing a talk on brain mets, we'd talk about radiation necrosis too because that's a big area that keeps you awake at night.\", 'But in those patients, if we just radiated smaller areas, maybe, we would have less toxicity.', \"So, that's the, I think, the areas that we still need to answer but maybe we should be screening in some patients.\", \"So, I think there are no additional questions, maybe, just a comment because you just touched maybe, I think it's important on PARP inhibitors in BRCA-mutated patients.\", 'So, maybe just some summary on the management of these women according to their subtype because I think this is important as well.', \"Yeah, I think that it is really important, and I think that we, it probably doesn't keep me awake as much at night because it's a small percentage of our population.\", \"So, I didn't include it there.\", \"And, of course, there's limits to what you can talk about.\", \"But if it's so important for patients to have had germline BRCA testing.\", \"And if you're gonna do it, if patient comes to you and they haven't had germline BRCA testing, you can do next generation sequencing, which you were gonna do anyway for the cancer and you will get the mutation.\", 'And then, you can go back and do germline testing.', 'So, swab of the mucosa or if finances are still an ongoing issue, you can treat them as BRCA positive because we have data suggesting that even for somatic mutations, we see responses with PARP inhibitors.', 'And then, I think another area that comes up is what about a patient has PALB2 mutation.', 'We see this in triple-negative disease as well as hormone receptor- positive disease.', 'And in that group of patients, how would we decide about PARP inhibitors.', 'And we have seen limited data but really encouraging that these cancers also to PARP inhibition.', 'S, I think that what I believe is that if you could give it, we try and give it.', \"You can get compassionate use from the companies that make PARP inhibitors if there's no approval within your country for the drug, largely, not always but sometimes, like if a patient has PALB2 mutation or a somatic mutation.\", 'And then, the other question is when should you give the PARP inhibitor with the other treatment?', \"And I think that for CDK4/ 6 inhibitors, we believe that you should give them first before the PARP inhibitor because we've seen these survival benefits.\", 'So, well-tolerated in most patients.', 'And then the PARP inhibitor would be second-line.', \"In triple-negative disease though, we just don't have great options for patients who are PD-L1 negative, which is the majority of our patients.\", 'So, if a patient could get a PARP inhibitor first-line, I would choose that because I think that it just depends on how much disease they have and whether they have visceral crisis.', \"But I also, although again it's completely off-label, I would use a PARP inhibitor as maintenance in patients after they got a response to chemotherapy if you have to start with chemo.\", 'Because I think the earlier you give the PARP inhibitor, the longer the patient will stay on and potentially those patients may have a benefit in survival in a unplanned subset analysis from the OlympiA trial.', \"So, I think here the scenario will become more and more complex because we will have adjuvant PARP inhibitors, it's like the CDK4/ 6.\", \"So, I think it'll become more and more complicated and we are going to test more and more.\", 'So, this population of patients will increase over time.', 'So, I think we need to be ready.', 'Also...', 'We just have a patient who was on a trial and got a CDK4/ 6 inhibitor in the early-stage setting.', 'And she got palbo so you could have given her just a different CDK4/ 6 inhibitor.', \"She didn't relapse on it.\", 'It was after stopping.', 'But she has a BRCA2 mutation and she had bone and pleura.', \"So, I started her actually on olaparib and she's still on it now.\", \"She's been on now for about seven months.\", \"So, it's actually a great option to consider.\", 'You just have to individualise.', 'And also, we tend to give carboplatin more and more in triple-negative patients.', \"And if they're are BRCA positive, we do not have data on PARP inhibitors after platinum compounds.\", 'So, I think there are lots of things which are overlapping and we cannot have answers for that and we will never have from clinical trials as well.', 'So, I think we are going out of our time.', 'I think it was really very useful.', 'So next time, you will be engaged again for this talk, Hope, so, because I think it was really very interesting and stimulating, and thank you very much.', 'Thank you very much, and thanks to all of you who are listening and for your great questions.', 'Thanks.', 'Take care.', 'Bye-bye.']\n",

Esta es una gran pregunta.', 'Lo mismo ocurre con la inmunoterapia.', 'La duración del tratamiento.', 'Y luego, el tratamiento de la ascitis resistente es un gran problema para nuestras pacientes.', 'El cáncer lobulillar suele ser un área donde realmente tenemos problemas para manejar el cáncer y el cáncer lobulillar en el espectro de la enfermedad es una cuestión creciente que afortunadamente ha logrado cierto reconocimiento.', 'Y luego, pacientes que tienen enfermedad de la pared torácica que puede ser increíblemente difícil de abordar.', 'Otra vez, he optado por no comentar esto porque no tenemos datos específicos con los que apoyar la toma de decisiones.', 'Con suerte, lo haremos en el futuro.', 'Así que empecemos y hablemos de inmunoterapia.', 'Vimos en el último año datos notables con inmunoterapia en el cáncer de mama tanto incipiente como avanzado con negatividad para receptores hormonales, HER2–, llamado cáncer de mama triple negativo.', 'Ya antes habíamos visto datos con atezolizumab, había una mejoría pequeña pero estadísticamente significativa en la supervivencia sin progresión y una gran mejoría en la supervivencia global.', 'Estos datos, que se presentaron el año pasado a partir del ensayo KEYNOTE-355, demostraron que la adición de pembrolizumab a un régimen de quimioterápicos en pacientes cuya enfermedad era PD-L1 positiva utilizando una cosa llamada puntuación positiva combinada o CPS mejoró la supervivencia global.', 'Datos previos habían demostrado una mejora de aproximadamente 4,1 meses en la supervivencia sin progresión.', 'Este aumento de casi 7 meses en la supervivencia global fue muy alentador.', 'Y pueden ver la curva separada a lo largo del tiempo, pero solo el 38% de las pacientes se benefician, tomando como base esta puntuación positiva combinada.', 'Por lo tanto, sigue siendo un gran problema para nosotros.', 'Seleccionar a las pacientes, tratar de decidir el origen del tumor, ¿deberíamos hacer una biopsia del tumor metastásico o utilizar tejido tumoral de archivo?', 'En estos estudios, un gran número de pacientes contaba con un tumor de archivo que se utilizó para determinar la puntuación positiva combinada.', 'Ahora, en este contexto concreto de la enfermedad, puede no ser tan importante porque muchas de las pacientes recidivaban en el año siguiente a su último tratamiento en el estadio incipiente.', 'Pero aun así termina siendo un tema de debate vigente, qué tumor deberíamos usar para las pruebas.', 'Preferimos usar tumores de la enfermedad metastásica si podemos.', 'Pero dada la necesidad de obtenerlo en cuanto se diagnostica a una paciente, a menudo haremos la prueba del tumor en tejido de archivo mientras obtenemos la biopsia para confirmar la enfermedad metastásica.', 'También queremos ver si podríamos o no ampliar el número de pacientes que se beneficiarían de la inmunoterapia.', 'Estos datos presentados por Javier Cortés en San Antonio este año muestran que, efectivamente, aquí se muestra una CPS de 10.', 'Este es el punto de corte de la puntuación positiva combinada de 10 o más.', 'Aquí tenemos 10 o más, 20 o más para la supervivencia global y la supervivencia sin progresión fue realmente el punto de corte correcto.', 'Y se establece que una CPS de 10 es el punto de corte para determinar el beneficio de añadir pembrolizumab a este régimen de quimioterapia.', 'Las opciones de quimioterapia incluyeron nab-paclitaxel, paclitaxel o gemcitabina y carboplatino.', 'Algunos médicos pueden preferir el uso de GemCarbo incluso en pacientes que no han recibido un taxano previamente porque no se observa pérdida de cabello y no hay problemas de neuropatía, aunque es posible que con el tiempo haya problemas de trombocitopenia.', 'Pero, de hecho, resulta que cuando miras otros análisis de subgrupos, las pacientes que reciben taxanos pueden haber tenido mejores resultados que las pacientes que reciben gemcitabina y carboplatino, aunque el ensayo no tenía la potencia suficiente para examinar subgrupos.', 'Por lo tanto, en general, elegimos como acompañante un taxano si han pasado más de 6 meses desde la última exposición de una paciente a un taxano en el estadio incipiente.', 'Es muy importante tener en cuenta los acontecimientos adversos inmunomediados.', 'Se puede ver que los acontecimientos adversos inmunomediados de cualquier grado aumentaron en un 20%.', 'Y aquí es donde había al menos 10 pacientes en cualquier grupo de tratamiento.', 'Las toxicidades más frecuentes que hemos visto afectan a la glándula tiroidea y, de hecho, la piel es bastante frecuente en el estadio incipiente, así como en la enfermedad metastásica.', 'Pero cualquier órgano puede verse afectado.', 'Dado que el sistema inmunitario está más inhibido en pacientes con metástasis que en casos incipientes, mi experiencia clínica es que tendemos a ver menos toxicidades orgánicas.', 'Vemos neumonitis como se puede ver en colitis pero hepatitis, menos frecuente.', 'Vemos algo menos insuficiencia suprarrenal.', 'Las pacientes están recibiendo corticoesteroides por lo que puede que tampoco podamos verlo.', 'Además, la mediana de supervivencia de estas pacientes, y voy a volver a esta diapositiva.', 'Pueden ver que la mediana de supervivencia sigue siendo de 23 meses.', 'Así que estas pacientes no viven durante mucho tiempo.', 'Por lo tanto, sigue siendo un gran problema para nosotros.', 'Pero lo que encontré es que realmente es necesario poder identificar estas toxicidades inmunitarias pronto.', 'Así que si una paciente aparece con algún tipo de síntoma extraño relacionado con su tratamiento o no relacionado, tienes que pensar en la toxicidad inmunitaria.', 'Hemos visto incluso esofagitis eosinofílica como una toxicidad y estas toxicidades pueden ocurrir tres meses o más después de la última dosis del inhibidor de puntos de control.', 'Yo tuve una de las primeras pacientes que traté con un inhibidor de puntos de control que recibió una dosis en un ensayo clínico, que tenía enfermedad progresiva.', 'Y tres meses después presentó diarrea potencialmente mortal por colitis.', 'Eso fue, por supuesto, antes de que supiéramos que podíamos identificarla pronto.', 'Así que indudablemente tienes que pensar en la toxicidad inmunitaria con casi cualquier efecto secundario.', 'Y bueno, mencioné que Impassion-130 mostró un beneficio con la adición de atezolizumab al nab-paclitaxel.', 'Es decir, usaron un fármaco acompañante para la quimioterapia.', 'Y la diferencia aquí, se puede ver en la supervivencia sin progresión media se observó solo en las pacientes que tenían enfermedad con positividad para las células inmunitarias PD-L1.', 'Usaron un anticuerpo SP142 y no una puntuación positiva combinada.', 'El anticuerpo con una puntuación positiva combinada es 22C3.', 'Les comentaré algo acerca de esto dentro de un momento.', 'Inicialmente, mostraron una mejora en la supervivencia global de alrededor de 6,3 meses.', 'Pero con el seguimiento a largo plazo, la diferencia es muy similar a la observada con pembrolizumab, como les acabo de mostrar con una mejora de 7 meses en la supervivencia global.', 'Como pueden ver, las pacientes sin taxanos previos parecen tener mejor cociente de riesgos instantáneos en la supervivencia global.', 'Probablemente debido al desarrollo de resistencia a lo largo del tiempo.', 'Pero es algo digno de mención.', 'Estos son los llamados análisis de referencia, y van del 22% al 36% a los 3 años cuando se sabe que la mediana de la supervivencia sigue siendo de solo unos 2 años.', 'Por lo tanto, hay un subgrupo de pacientes que de verdad se benefician enormemente de la inmunoterapia, pero en Impassion-130, solo el 40%, casi idéntico a KEYNOTE-355.', 'Entonces, lo que pasó con Impassion-130 es en realidad, creo, una lección muy importante para todos nosotros sobre diseño estadístico.', 'No me queda claro exactamente, a pesar de que formaba parte del comité de dirección, por qué tenían un plan de análisis estadístico predefinido jerárquico.', 'Por lo tanto, lo que dijeron fue que había que tener un beneficio en la población por intención de tratar en cuanto a la SSP y la SG con el fin de considerar el beneficio en el subgrupo de pacientes con enfermedad PD-L1+.', 'Así que, vieron un beneficio en la SSP y la intención de tratar, entonces pudieron continuar para demostrar que el beneficio era solo en las pacientes con PD-L1+.', 'Pero para la SG, como cabría esperar, no hubo diferencia en las pacientes de la población por intención de tratar porque solo el 40% eran PD-L1+.', 'Entonces, esto fue...', 'Se puede ver el beneficio, parece clínicamente muy importante, pero el diseño estadístico no permitió observar la supervivencia global en los pacientes PD-L1+, debido al análisis por intención de tratar.', 'Así que necesitaron un ensayo confirmatorio para tener la autorización plena.', 'Y el siguiente ensayo que hicieron, Impassion-131, no mostró un beneficio al agregar atezolizumab por razones muy poco claras, ya que vimos estos datos muy alentadores con pembrolizumab y datos alentadores en la enfermedad incipiente.', 'Por lo tanto, esto llevó a la retirada de la autorización acelerada del atezolizumab en los EE. UU. en la indicación de metástasis.', 'Hay un estudio en curso que sigue analizando el atezolizumab en la indicación de metástasis en un ensayo de fase III y no se retiró la autorización en otros países porque esto no era un requisito.', 'Fue de la FDA de los EE. UU. pero, ciertamente, creo que ha resultado en un menor uso del atezolizumab en este contexto.', 'Les muestro estos datos del otro ensayo, el Impassion-131, el ensayo negativo.', 'Este ensayo, como pueden ver, incluyó casi el mismo número de pacientes.', 'Y el PD-L1 era positivo en el 45%.', 'El paclitaxel fue el fármaco acompañante en lugar del nab-paclitaxel, pero se utilizaron corticoesteroides en el ensayo KEYNOTE-355 debido a la naturaleza de la quimioterapia.', 'Las pacientes no tratadas _de novo_ fueron algunas menos, pero similares a KEYNOTE-355, taxanos previos, de nuevo, un poco más y menos en KEYNOTE-355.', 'Es posible que estas diferencias, que no podemos entender realmente, hayan marcado la diferencia en cuanto a no mostrar ningún beneficio en la SSP.', 'Aquí, se puede ver que la SSP era idéntica, pero tampoco hubo beneficio en la supervivencia.', 'Y la supervivencia global en la población de pacientes que recibieron paclitaxel en solitario fue de 28 meses, mayor de lo que habíamos visto nunca antes.', 'Por lo tanto, se plantea la cuestión de si esta población de pacientes de verdad era o no biológicamente diferente y si deberíamos o no estar haciendo subtipificación intrínseca para conocer mejor el beneficio de la quimioterapia en estas pacientes.', 'Quiero parar aquí para recordarles a todos que pueden hacer preguntas y comentarios en cualquier momento.', 'Así que, cualquier cosa que surja, simplemente pongan algo en el recuadro de preguntas y respuestas.', 'Envíen sus preguntas y comentarios.', 'Queremos escucharlos y que nos digan lo que piensan.', 'Y no tiene por qué ser una pregunta.', 'Puede ser un comentario.', 'Así que espero recibir sus aportaciones.', 'Envíenlas mientras hablamos.', 'Entonces, ¿qué preguntas nos hacemos sobre el uso metastásico de los inhibidores de puntos de control?', 'Bueno, ¿por qué el PD-L1 solo es importante para la enfermedad metastásica?', 'Creemos que esto se debe a la supresión inmunitaria de la carga de morbimortalidad.', 'Es muy interesante que hayamos demostrado que el beneficio de los inhibidores de puntos de control es relativamente mayor en la enfermedad en estadio más alto y con afectación ganglionar en el estadio incipiente, donde el pembrolizumab neoadyuvante está aprobado ahora en los Estados Unidos a partir de los resultados del estudio KEYNOTE-522.', 'Así, sabemos que la carga de morbimortalidad se asocia con una menor probabilidad de respuesta patológica completa e incluso en pacientes de una RPC, un resultado relativamente algo peor.', 'Entonces, ¿podría ser que sea la carga de morbimortalidad?', 'Y sospecho que lo que estamos viendo aquí, y ha habido algunos estudios muy buenos que lo demuestran con muestras emparejadas, es una reducción de la expresión del PD-L1 y, lo que es más importante, una disminución de los linfocitos infiltrantes de tumores y un aumento de la complejidad mutacional que aumenta la resistencia a la quimioterapia y una reducción en el anfitrión, la capacidad del anfitrión de responder al tumor inmunitariamente.', 'Por lo tanto, el tumor, en realidad, cuanto mayor es la carga de morbimortalidad que se tiene, mejor es la capacidad del tumor para suprimir la respuesta inmunitaria del anfitrión.', 'El mejor fármaco acompañante de la quimioterapia, todavía...', 'Ya lo he mencionado, todavía elegiríamos el nab-paclitaxel si pudiéramos como fármaco acompañante de la quimioterapia y en pacientes que han recibido un taxano y tienen enfermedad resistente, gemcitabina y carboplatino.', 'Realmente no sabemos cuánto tiempo continuar con el inhibidor de puntos de control, así que tenemos pacientes que han tenido una respuesta excelente.', 'Y luego, detenemos la quimioterapia y continuamos con el inhibidor de puntos de control.', 'El KEYNOTE-355 suspendió el pembrolizumab a los 2 años, atezolizumab continuó el inhibidor de puntos de control.', 'Así que no sabemos y sabemos que puede haber más toxicidad inmunitaria cuanto más larga sea la exposición.', 'Y luego, por supuesto, unas cuantas pacientes se benefician relativamente en una población clínica real.', 'Podría ser solo el 30% o así.', 'Tenemos que buscar nuevas combinaciones y tratar de mejorar la efectividad de los inhibidores de puntos de control.', 'Y también estamos extendiendo los inhibidores de puntos de control a otros subgrupos de la enfermedad como la enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales.', 'Y la gran pregunta es ¿qué subgrupos debemos incluir y cómo debemos identificarlos?', 'No estoy segura de que los ensayos aleatorizados de fase III estén identificando la población correcta.', 'Así que ya veremos.', 'Y luego, hay muchos ensayos y el entorno neoadyuvante, post-neoadyuvante y metastásico que analizan los inhibidores de puntos de control en la enfermedad HER2+.', 'A la derecha, les muestro que las pruebas que se hacen para determinar la positividad del PD-L1 son realmente importantes, y esa también era una pregunta constante.', 'Aquí, pueden ver que en el ensayo Impassion-130, pudimos demostrar que había cierta superposición en la positividad con SP142 y la CPS.', 'Pero creo que, por otro lado, hubo muchas pacientes que tuvieron enfermedad positiva solo por SP142 o 22C3 usando el punto de corte de la CPS de 10.', 'Entonces, es muy interesante.', 'Y ahora he visto algunas pacientes que inicialmente tenían un SP142 que era 0 y tienen una CPS de 50.', 'Entonces, este es realmente un verdadero problema, y estoy segura de que veremos lo contrario también.', 'No estamos haciendo SP142 ahora en los Estados Unidos.', 'Hay muchos estudios diferentes que están investigando cómo amplificar la respuesta inmunitaria.', 'Les acabo de mostrar algunos.', 'Terapia de inducción para tratar de mejorar la respuesta inmunitaria del anfitrión con poca quimioterapia o radioterapia.', 'Hay un ensayo de fase II en curso que analiza la inducción con doxorubicina tomando como base la respuesta más alta que se muestra aquí con una pequeña dosis de inducción de doxorubicina y luego nivolumab en monoterapia.', 'Estamos usando la inducción en un ensayo financiado por la BCRF, la Breast Cancer Research Foundation, con varios agentes diferentes, un inhibidor de MEK, el CAF sacituzumab govitecán y doxorubicina liposomal.', 'Sabemos que potencia la respuesta inmunitaria en el contexto neoadyuvante.', 'Y luego lo combinamos con el inhibidor de puntos de control avelumab después de una inducción de 2 semanas.', 'Y Sara Tolaney y Ana Garrido-Castro están estudiando el sacituzumab en monoterapia o en combinación con pembrolizumab como tratamiento de primera línea en pacientes con cáncer de mama triple negativo metastásico, así como con enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales.', 'En San Antonio se obtuvieron datos interesantes de pacientes que recibían combinaciones de inmunoterapia y que presentaban una elevada carga mutacional tumoral o una enfermedad metastásica con HER2– hipermutada.', 'Pero es interesante señalar que la mayoría de estas pacientes tienen cáncer lobulillar.', 'Y repito, es muy importante tener esto en cuenta.', 'Se están llevando a cabo estudios sobre combinaciones con inhibidores de la PARP que podrían potenciar la respuesta inmunitaria y la radioterapia que creo que serán muy importantes para nosotros en el futuro.', 'Este es un ejemplo de los datos previos.', 'Es decir, los datos complementarios del estudio de un inhibidor de puntos de control en la enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales.', 'Se trataba de pacientes que tenían enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales con amplios antecedentes terapéuticos con PD-L1 positivo a las que les administramos pembrolizumab en monoterapia.', 'La respuesta global fue del 12%.', 'El número de pacientes era escaso, solo 25, pero las respuestas fueron muy duraderas en las que respondieron.', 'Y esto pueden verlo aquí en este gráfico de barras y luego en el gráfico de espagueti aquí donde pueden ver las pacientes que tuvieron una respuesta.', 'Realmente era bastante duradera.', 'Así que creo que es muy interesante.', 'Ahora combinamos los inhibidores de puntos de control con quimioterapia porque sabemos que la quimioterapia potencia la respuesta inmunitaria.', 'Este es el ensayo KEYNOTE-B49 en curso, del cual soy la IP estadounidense, y Peter Schmid es el IP europeo.', 'Las pacientes pueden recibir de nuevo un régimen de quimioterapia que incluya paclitaxel, nab-paclitaxel, doxorubicina liposomal o capecitabina junto con pembrolizumab.', 'Y luego, para ser elegibles, las pacientes deben tener enfermedad PD-L1+.', 'Así que, esperamos que con esto se pueda esquivar el hecho de que no se está dividiendo al grupo de pacientes por criterios biológicos como por ejemplo pacientes que tienen más enfermedad luminal B, enfermedad con más resistencia endocrina.', 'Y el punto de corte de la CPS es uno.', 'Por lo tanto, tendremos que buscar un CPS de 10 o más en el análisis final como se muestra aquí.', 'Así que, este ensayo, por supuesto, está reclutando pacientes, aunque lentamente, porque el número de pacientes que son CPS positivas y que tienen enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales es pequeño y no hemos descubierto exactamente cómo identificarlas.', 'Pero esperemos que esto mejore con el tiempo.', 'Los conjugados de anticuerpo y fármaco son una nueva área realmente apasionante.', 'El conjugado de anticuerpo y fármaco sacituzumab govitecán es un anticuerpo Trop-2 con el metabolito activo del irinotecán unido y con un elevado cociente fármaco-anticuerpo.', 'Entonces, la toxina es SN-38, lo cual es estupendo porque estás suministrando la toxina directamente a la célula cancerosa con un conjugado de anticuerpo y fármaco.', 'También se produce algo llamado efecto espectador o de vecindad, que es algo muy interesante, y significa que incluso los tumores que no expresan la diana del anticuerpo pueden ser destruidos.', 'Algunos CAF producen un mejor efecto de vecindad que otros y es algo que no entendemos bien.', 'Tampoco entendemos la toxicidad de los CAF.', 'Realmente no podemos medir la toxina en la sangre, pero aún vemos toxicidades relacionadas con la toxina con todos los CAF de nueva generación mucho más que trastuzumab emtansina.', 'Con sacituzumab, vemos más neutropenia.', 'Aproximadamente el 50% de las pacientes necesitó factores de crecimiento, pero casi ninguna paciente suspendió el tratamiento debido a acontecimientos adversos.', 'Así que se puede controlar casi toda la toxicidad bien y la diarrea, se puede manejar bastante bien.', '10% de grado 3, pero con antidiarreicos y reducción de la dosis, es fácil de controlar.', 'El primer análisis del ensayo ASCENT que se muestra aquí demostró una mejora en la supervivencia sin progresión y en la supervivencia global que fue estadísticamente significativa en pacientes con amplios antecedentes terapéuticos con enfermedad triple negativa.', 'O sea, los datos son muy interesantes y esto estableció el sacituzumab como una nueva opción de tratamiento en la segunda línea o posterior para el cáncer de mama triple negativo.', 'Pero, por supuesto, las pacientes siguen muriendo de cáncer y como pueden ver aquí, la mediana de la supervivencia global fue de 12,1 meses en estas pacientes en las que la mediana del número de líneas previas de tratamiento fue de tres a cuatro.', 'Entonces, ¿qué más podemos hacer?', 'Bueno, estamos evaluando otros CAF y luego, podemos pasar estos fármacos, por supuesto, a la enfermedad en estadio incipiente.', 'El datopotamab deruxtecán es un CAF Trop-2 que les mostraré dentro de un momento.', 'Y luego, el ladiratuzumab vedotina se dirige contra LIV1A, ese es el anticuerpo, pero la toxina provoca neuropatía.', 'Aún se está evaluando con diferentes esquemas posológicos.', 'El trastuzumab deruxtecán, por supuesto, se está evaluando en la enfermedad con HER2 bajo.', 'Una vez más, hablaré sobre esto dentro de un momento.', 'Y luego hay un CAF de HER3 que tiene el estado de tecnología innovadora de la FDA de los EE. UU. para el cáncer de pulmón no microcítico con eGFR mutado.', 'Hay varios ensayos de fase III de los que hablaremos en un momento.', 'Y luego, nuevas vías en combinación con inmunoterapia que, creo, son muy interesantes también.', 'Este ensayo con el datopotamab deruxtecán ya está abierto y reclutando, el TROPION-Breast01 en el cáncer de mama con positividad para receptores hormonales y ese ensayo en la enfermedad triple negativa se abrirá más adelante este año.', 'Solo tenemos datos, es interesante, con Dato-Dxd en enfermedad triple negativa pero esperamos ver enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales en ASCO.', 'Estos datos se actualizaron en San Antonio en 2021 y mostraron unas tasas de respuesta muy buenas en este pequeño número de pacientes y en las pacientes que no habían recibido previamente un CAF basado en inhibidores de la topoisomerasa I, la tasa de respuesta fue superior al 50%.', 'Pero repito, esto es solo en 27 pacientes.', 'Y pueden ver que las respuestas fueron notablemente duraderas con este conjugado de anticuerpo y fármaco.', 'Lo interesante de este CAF es que la proporción fármaco-anticuerpo para trastuzumab deruxtecán y sacituzumab es de 7 y medio a 8.', 'Para este, son como 4.', 'Pero la toxicidad es completamente diferente.', 'Parece muy efectivo, pero hubo muchas náuseas, cosa que vemos con el trastuzumab deruxtecán.', 'Así que creo que esta es la toxina.', 'Pero vieron mucha estomatitis y el 10% era de grado 3.', 'Así que no tenemos idea de por qué es así, ya que esto no lo hemos visto con ningún otro CAF que use deruxtecán como toxina.', 'El HER2-bajo es un campo muy interesante y en la actualidad, se ha vuelto aún más apasionante.', 'Esta es una definición extraña, no es claramente una definición biológicamente relevante, pero todavía se definió basándose en un estudio de fase I inicial con trastuzumab deruxtecán.', 'Por lo tanto, el HER2-bajo tiene una mayor prevalencia en la enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales que en la enfermedad triple negativa, del 65% frente al 37%.', 'Se define como ser 1+ o 2+ por inmunohistoquímica para HER2– y no amplificado por hibridación _in situ_.', 'Así, se puede ver que esto también se divide en luminal A, luminal B, HER2 enriquecido y similar a basal.', 'Y lo que pueden ver es que una vez que tienes IHQ 1 y 2+ no amplificada, se ven relativamente menos similares al basal en comparación con IHQ 0, y se ve una expansión de luminal B. Es decir, aquí es donde realmente está todo este grupo.', 'La mayoría de estas pacientes tienen enfermedad luminal A y B, lo cual es interesante porque, por supuesto, es una cohorte con positividad para receptores hormonales.', 'Hay varios ensayos en curso.', 'El DESTINY-Breast06, hay ensayos que están analizando la comparación con la quimioterapia de elección del médico.', 'Hay uno de disitamab vedotina que también está analizando la enfermedad HER2-bajo que está dirigido a HER2.', 'Pero el DESTINY-Breast04, que es un ensayo de fase III que aleatorizó a pacientes que tenían HER2-bajo definido centralmente, un cáncer de mama metastásico que limitó el número de pacientes con enfermedad triple negativa.', 'Las pacientes fueron aleatorizadas en proporción 2 a 1 para recibir trastuzumab deruxtecán o quimioterapia de elección del médico, y los números se exponen aquí.', 'Pueden ver el número total de pacientes del ensayo, 360 frente a 180.', 'El criterio principal de valoración: fue la SSP, los criterios secundarios de valoración, la supervivencia global y, por supuesto, la respuesta y la duración de la respuesta.', 'Nosotros participamos en este ensayo que permitía incluir pacientes que habían recibido hasta dos líneas previas de quimioterapia y habían agotado sus opciones de tratamiento endocrino.', 'Hoy hubo un comunicado de prensa de AstraZeneca y Daiichi Sankyo, que colaboraron juntos en este fármaco, que tiene el nombre comercial de Enhertu y acabo de copiar y pegar el comunicado de prensa, así que aparece un nombre comercial aquí.', 'Pero se demostró que hubo una mejora no solo en la supervivencia sin progresión, sino también en la supervivencia global.', 'Y esto demuestra una mejora estadísticamente significativa, y por supuesto, clínicamente trascendente, en la SSP y la SG en la enfermedad HER2-bajo, la enfermedad metastásica en primera o segunda línea, supongo, en segunda o tercera línea.', 'Entonces, dicen con independencia del estado de los receptores hormonales.', 'Así que deben haber visto esto tanto en el grupo de triple negativo como en el grupo con positividad para receptores hormonales.', 'Es decir, datos muy, muy interesantes que veremos en ASCO este año, pero que cambiarán la forma en que tratamos a las pacientes con enfermedad metastásica, creo, en un futuro no muy lejano, dependiendo de la disponibilidad de los fármacos.', 'También resalto el hecho de que el sacituzumab govitecán se probó en la enfermedad metastásica con positividad para receptores hormonales con hasta más líneas de tratamiento.', 'O sea, tenías que recibir al menos dos líneas de quimioterapia y hasta cinco.', 'Es decir, con antecedentes terapéuticos más amplios en comparación con la quimioterapia de elección del médico.', 'Estos datos se presentarán en la ASCO, pero aún no están disponibles para nosotros, aunque deberían estarlo en un futuro próximo.', 'Y bueno, repito, preguntas, en cualquier momento, si tienen comentarios.', 'Todavía no veo nada en el recuadro de comentarios pero por favor siéntanse libres de poner comentarios en el recuadro de preguntas y respuestas y preguntas en cualquier momento.', 'Y bueno, las metástasis cerebrales son claramente una necesidad clínica por cubrir.', 'Es una localización frecuente de la enfermedad metastásica, hasta el 50% de las pacientes con cáncer de mama HER2+, hasta el 50% con enfermedad metastásica triple negativa y a menudo conduce a una muerte rápida en el cáncer de mama triple negativo.', 'Y luego, en la enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales, vemos más metástasis cerebrales porque nuestras pacientes viven más y tenemos mejores opciones de tratamiento.', 'Parece aumentar en pacientes que tienen mutaciones en PIK3CA y en aproximadamente la mitad de las pacientes que tienen mutaciones de BRCA en la línea germinal.', 'Se puede ver en pacientes, como, muy doloroso, que tienen una enfermedad sistémica muy bien controlada.', 'Podemos ver una progresión inexorable continua en el encéfalo y después, desarrollo de enfermedad leptomeníngea con el tiempo.', 'Y aquí pueden ver este realce de las leptomeninges también en esta paciente.', 'La recidiva después de la radiación es frecuente y la toxicidad por radiación es limitante para las pacientes.', 'Y, por supuesto, debido a la barrera hematoencefálica que no entendemos bien, hay una exposición limitada a los citotóxicos.', 'Y la mayoría de los ensayos, hasta hace muy poco, excluían a las pacientes con metástasis cerebrales.', 'Vimos, a pesar de que mejoramos notablemente el resultado para la enfermedad HER2+ que incluso cuando dimos a pacientes con enfermedad residual T-DM1 o el conjugado de anticuerpo y fármaco frente al trastuzumab y se demostró una gran mejoría en las pacientes que están en riesgo de recidiva a distancia que todavía había un riesgo continuado de enfermedad del SNC que no se modificó.', 'Esto muestra que la recidiva a distancia mejoró mucho desde el ensayo KATHERINE con T-DM1 pero no hay diferencias en el desarrollo de metástasis en el SNC.', 'Esto despertó mucho interés por tratar de entender cómo podríamos mejorar el resultado.', 'Hay varias combinaciones diferentes de quimioterapia que han mostrado una eficacia limitada en pacientes con metástasis cerebrales resistentes.', 'Pero son generalmente de corta duración con la excepción de algunos estudios pequeños, bevacizumab, cisplatino, etopósido en 35 pacientes, por ejemplo.', 'Donde hemos visto más mejoría es en terapias dirigidas a HER2, no con estos grupos, pero vimos algunas respuestas.', 'Incluso lo vemos con trastuzumab emtansina o T-DM1 donde hubo una tasa de respuesta en 10 pacientes del 30%.', 'Siguen siendo números pequeños pero aun así alentadores.', 'Ahora vamos a hablar sobre algunos de los datos que tenemos.', 'Por ejemplo, examinamos el abemaciclib como una colaboración en pacientes que tenían metástasis cerebrales. Lilly y Sara Tolaney publicaron estos datos en 2020 mostrando respuestas muy limitadas en pacientes con metástasis cerebrales.', 'Vemos estas supervivencias más largas en pacientes que tienen enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales.', 'Esta es la cohorte con positividad para receptores hormonales y HER2–, con una tasa de respuesta del 5,2%, solo 3 pacientes de 58 pero la tasa de beneficio clínico intracraneal fue del 24%.', 'Por lo tanto, aunque no alcanzaron su criterio principal de valoración en las pacientes con enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales y metástasis cerebrales, solemos elegir el abemaciclib como inhibidor de CDK4/6 acompañante del tratamiento endocrino.', 'Vieron mucho abemaciclib en el LCR, una evaluación interesante, donde estudiaron los analitos de abemaciclib.', 'Poca respuesta en la enfermedad HER2+ y la enfermedad leptomeníngea.', 'De nuevo, vieron una respuesta pero fue de corta duración en estas pacientes, y solo se incluyeron 10 pacientes.', 'El neratinib y la capecitabina se han estudiado en pacientes con enfermedad HER2+.', 'Rachel Freedman publicó estos datos en el JCO.', 'Y pueden ver que de hecho había una tasa de respuesta del SNC bastante buena, del 49%.', 'Y si miran el... esto es mirando la respuesta volumétrica.', 'Si miran la suma de los diámetros mayores, es del 24%.', 'Así que sigue siendo bastante bueno comparado con lo que vimos antes.', 'Nueve respuestas y tendieron a ser más duraderas mientras las pacientes continuaban con el tratamiento.', 'Lamentablemente, esta combinación provoca mucha diarrea, pero sigue siendo una opción de tratamiento, aunque no sin la autorización reglamentaria.', 'Y luego vimos estos datos, que sí tienen la autorización reglamentaria, añadir tucatinib a trastuzumab y capecitabina en pacientes que han progresado con todas las terapias disponibles.', 'Trastuzumab, pertuzumab y trastuzumab emtansina.', 'Observaron una mejoría de la supervivencia sin progresión en las 291 pacientes con metástasis cerebrales.', 'Y este ensayo permitió que las pacientes continuaran, que tenían metástasis cerebrales activas, para las que las pacientes no necesitaban tratamiento inmediato.', 'Así que fue muy alentador.', 'Y aquí, pueden ver que no fue solo la supervivencia sin progresión sino la supervivencia global lo que mejoró en pacientes con metástasis cerebrales.', 'Y he administrado tucatinib a dos pacientes que tenían metástasis cerebrales progresivas a pesar de la radiación y que realmente no pueden recibir más radiación.', 'Una de las pacientes no tuvo una buena respuesta pero sospecho que era una necrosis por radiación que no, no fue leída aprop., no pudimos saber.', 'Pero la otra paciente que tiene múltiples metástasis cerebrales quísticas y que básicamente habría pasado a cuidados paliativos, por el contrario se sometió a este régimen triple de HER2CLIMB y ahora, todavía tiene respuesta continuada de la enfermedad 8 meses después de comenzar esta terapia.', 'Y es realmente extraordinario.', 'Cada RM cerebral secuencial muestra respuesta al tratamiento.', 'Así es que, es muy emocionante.', 'El DESTINY-Breast03 también examinó a pacientes que tenían metástasis cerebrales al inicio pero tenían que estar controladas.', 'Entonces, es un poco diferente.', 'Sara Hurvitz presentó estos datos en San Antonio este año.', 'Y aquí se muestran los antecedentes de las metástasis cerebrales o metástasis cerebrales al inicio con datos en ese grupo.', 'Y es interesante porque en este ensayo se analizó el trastuzumab deruxtecán frente al T-DM1.', 'Es decir, T-DXd frente al T-DM1, y pueden ver que hubo una marcada mejoría en la mediana de la supervivencia sin progresión usando T-DXd y la tasa de SSP a 12 meses con un cociente de riesgos instantáneos de 0,25 si había metástasis cerebrales al inicio.', 'Parece que puede haber efectividad en esa población de pacientes.', 'Se está evaluado ahora.', 'Por lo tanto, esta es una evaluación en curso.', 'Las tasas de respuesta intracraneal se muestran aquí en pacientes con metástasis cerebrales.', 'En realidad miran a ver si las metástasis cerebrales se han reducido aún más.', 'Ahora bien, no se pueden eliminar los efectos a largo plazo de la radiación pero aun así, esa mejora espectacular, casi el doble, es muy alentadora.', 'Aquí se muestra la respuesta intracraneal, otra vez, usando los criterios RECIST 1.1.', 'Y pueden ver que es mucho mejor para T-DM1 en comparación con T-DXd.', 'En realidad, quería mencionar algo que es importante considerar en las metástasis cerebrales y es que hay gente piensa que RECIST quizás no sea la mejor forma o la respuesta volumétrica.', 'Así que, los criterios de respuesta RANO son una forma de analizar la respuesta volumétrica.', 'Y se muestra cómo se usan las lesiones indicadoras con respuesta completa, respuesta parcial y enfermedad estable.', 'Estudiar esto es realmente muy útil e incluye la respuesta volumétrica, que creo que es muy útil.', 'Publicado en 2015.', 'Bien, de nuevo, veo que hay un par de preguntas, que responderemos en un momento porque estamos a punto de terminar.', 'Creo que hay un área muy importante creo que hay un área muy importante, prevenir el deterioro cognitivo.', 'Con la radiación a lo largo del tiempo, una y otra vez, la radiación estereotáctica en el encéfalo completo. La radiación estereotáctica en el encéfalo completo.', 'Y presentan...', 'Algunas de estas pacientes tienen una terrible disfunción cognitiva que contribuye a su muerte.', 'La memantina en un ensayo aleatorizado de fase III mostró un tiempo hasta el deterioro cognitivo significativamente mayor.', 'Si se toma memantina durante la radioterapia en el encéfalo completo y la mayoría de las pacientes continúa tomándola y luego, la técnica de radiación alterada es el intento más reciente para reducir los efectos a largo plazo es el intento más reciente para reducir los efectos a largo plazo. Y la añadimos a la radioterapia en el encéfalo completo, entonces básicamente tratamos de preservar el hipocampo entonces básicamente tratamos de evitar la radiación del hipocampo usando la radioterapia de intensidad modulada.', 'Y en realidad, hubo una reducción significativa en el riesgo de fallo cognitivo y menos deterioro a los 4 y 6 meses tanto en la función ejecutiva como en el aprendizaje en la memoria. Así, esto se ha convertido en estándar para la radioterapia en el encéfalo completo al menos en nuestra institución.', 'Y por último, la enfermedad leptomeníngea es un área terrible para la progresión del cáncer de mama.', 'Estos son datos más antiguos, estos son datos más antiguos, pero noto que los estamos viendo con mucha más frecuencia ahora.', 'Se ve más en la histología lobulillar y el 35% de las pacientes con enfermedad leptomeníngea tienen histología lobulillar así como enfermedad triple negativa.', 'Y la esperanza de vida después del diagnóstico tiende a ser muy corta a menos que sea en el momento del diagnóstico inicial. Por lo general, el diagnóstico se hace revisando el LCR. El diagnóstico se hace revisando el LCR. Y buscamos otras maneras de hacer el diagnóstico de ELM en pacientes que tienen síntomas en esas células usando ácido desoxirribonucleico libre.', 'Se ha administrado tratamiento por vía intratecal con metotrexato, pero se están evaluando nuevos caminos, por resultados algo decepcionantes del trastuzumab intratecal.', 'Y la radiación se usa de antemano para lesiones voluminosas.', 'Hay varios estudios diferentes que están siendo, tratamientos que se han evaluado.', 'En mi opinión algunos de los más interesantes eran usar pembrolizumab o nivolumab i.v. o intratecal, lo cual es muy interesante.', 'Y hay un informe de un caso de uno de nuestros colegas principales que analizaba la administración intratecal de un inhibidor de puntos de control al melanoma y demostró esta reducción drástica de la enfermedad en una paciente con ELM.', 'Hay un fármaco muy interesante, el paclitaxel conjugado con angiopep-2 que actúa en un receptor llamado LRP1 en la barrera hematoencefálica que está aumentado en tumores encefálicos.', 'Y esta actuación facilita la transcitosis mediada por receptores a través de la barrera hematoencefálica.', 'Tienen algunos resultados preliminares muy interesantes y han tenido algunos problemas cuando la empresa ha sido adquirida por otra y el desarrollo de medicamentos.', 'Pero espero que pronto veamos todo esto en un ensayo clínico.', 'Y luego mis colegas y otros estudian el ácido desoxirribonucleico libre y el LCR para caracterizar el entorno inmunitario y buscar posibles dianas quizás también para una detección temprana.', 'También, la terapia de secuenciación.', 'Les mostraré esto cuando terminemos aquí.', 'En la enfermedad PD-L1+, usamos pembrolizumab, elección de quimioterapia basada en el tiempo desde la última terapia, inhibidores de PARP en pacientes que tienen mutaciones de BRCA en la línea germinal y tal vez en aquellas que presentan mutaciones somáticas adquiridas de BRCA.', 'Con BRCA no mutado, realmente no tenemos grandes opciones más que la quimioterapia y el conjugado de anticuerpo y fármaco sacituzumab.', 'Tal vez también tendremos el trastuzumab deruxtecán en un futuro próximo.', 'Y luego, para la carga mutacional tumoral elevada y mucha inestabilidad de microsatélites, se puede usar pembrolizumab teniendo en cuenta la autorización en EE. UU.', 'Depende de dónde esté aprobado.', 'Y el atezolizumab todavía está aprobado en muchos lugares del mundo.', 'Para la enfermedad con positividad de receptores hormonales, esto es como una pequeña diapositiva, pero de nuestra actualización de la directriz de ASCO, básicamente, la recomendación de todas las directrices es que se usen inhibidores de CDK4/6 como tratamiento de primera línea, preferiblemente en combinación con un inhibidor de la aromatasa a menos que una paciente ya haya recibido un IA y haya desarrollado enfermedad metastásica, en cuyo caso, que se muestra aquí, se optaría por fulvestrant.', 'Pero de lo contrario, creo que ahora mismo, preferimos reservar el fulvestrant para el tratamiento de segunda línea en combinación con alpelisib o everólimus en función del estado mutacional de PIK3CA.', 'Y controlar la toxicidad de esos fármacos es otra área que nos quita el sueño.', 'Y luego, por supuesto, se puede usar tamoxifeno.', 'No sabemos lo que hacen las CDK después de los inhibidores de CDK4/6, y hay mucho interés en esa área también, cómo usar tratamiento endocrino como tercera línea.', 'Hay un montón de trabajos en curso con reductores orales selectivos de los receptores de estrógenos y nuevos tratamientos endocrinos como los moduladores de los receptores de andrógenos que creo que nos darán muchas más opciones en el futuro que podremos usar en pacientes que recibieron un inhibidor de CDK4/6 en el contexto adyuvante donde ahora tendremos una cuestión adicional sobre cómo tratar a esas pacientes.', 'Me saltaré esta y pasaré a la enfermedad metastásica con HER2+ en la que hemos progresado mucho con el trastuzumab deruxtecán y con la pauta de tucatinib HER2CLIMB, lo que realmente ha cambiado nuestra secuenciación del tratamiento.', 'Y ahora, vamos a tener que pensar en el trastuzumab deruxtecán en pacientes que tienen enfermedad con HER2-bajo también.', 'Por último, la toxicidad económica es realmente un gran problema para nuestras pacientes y puede provocar el incumplimiento o el rechazo del tratamiento.', 'La gente pierde el trabajo.', 'Además, mueren antes si no reciben tratamiento.', 'Y este es un problema enorme.', 'Tenemos pacientes que no vienen para su tratamiento porque no tienen quien cuide a sus hijos o no pueden pagar sus medicamentos.', 'Y ese es un problema gravísimo, y es un tema muy candente en todo el mundo.', 'Ciertamente no lo hemos resuelto porque la cuestión económica es un problema para los pacientes en todas las áreas de la vida.', 'Y creo que es solo... abordar las dificultades económicas es muy importante cuando empezamos a tratar pacientes con cáncer de mama.', 'Así que terminaré solamente enumerando los otros temas de debate y pasaré el testigo a Olivia y les mostraré la guía de Consenso para el Cáncer de Mama Avanzado en la última reunión en persona.', 'En noviembre de este año tendremos un mini congreso en Lisboa y los animamos a todos a escucharlo o asistir si pueden.', 'Gracias, Hope.', 'Muy exhaustivo.', 'Y sí, realmente muy interesante, y también, genera muchas preguntas.', 'Tenemos dos preguntas de Simona.', 'La primera es, en pacientes con enfermedad leptomeníngea RH+, HER2–, ¿recomendaría el inhibidor de CDK4 o quimioterapia?', 'Y en caso afirmativo, ¿prefiere algún régimen?', 'Bueno, creo que depende mucho del volumen de enfermedad leptomeníngea que tengan.', 'Es decir, algunas pacientes no tienen síntomas y presentan cierto engrosamiento leptomeníngeo en las imágenes.', 'En estas pacientes, tiendo a tratarlas como si no tuvieran ELM y usaré... ...generalmente estas pacientes tienen la enfermedad en el propio SNC.', 'Entonces, yo trato con radioterapia y luego las trataría como si no tuvieran ELM.', 'Una de mis pacientes en realidad vivió casi cinco años y presentó inicialmente cáncer lobulillar bilateral, enfermedad leptomeníngea así como algunas metástasis encefálicas.', 'Y estaba bien sin recidiva de la enfermedad leptomeníngea y esta realmente no volvió a aparecer hasta mucho más tarde en el curso de la enfermedad.', 'Pero para la mayoría de las pacientes, este no es el caso y son sintomáticas.', 'Y lo que hago es inicialmente tratar con radiación y nuestros radiooncólogos también lo hacen.', 'A menos que la enfermedad se extienda y se quiera hacer una resonancia de la columna.', 'Entonces, observamos el encéfalo y luego la columna vertebral.', 'Si sufren la enfermedad en el encéfalo completo y la columna no se puede irradiar todo.', 'Así que, entonces yo aplico tratamiento intratecal con metotrexato.', 'Y luego, para la quimioterapia sistémica, intentamos usar los fármacos que atraviesan la barrera hematoencefálica.', 'O sea, capecitabina.', 'El etopósido no está aprobado para el cáncer de mama, pero uno de mis colegas que está muy interesado en esto ha administrado una combinación de cisplatino y etopósido con muy buenos resultados en un pequeño número de pacientes.', 'Realmente depende de en qué medida responden a la quimioterapia las células cancerosas que han invadido las leptomeninges y cómo es la enfermedad sistémica y lo sintomática que es la paciente.', 'Y cuántas líneas reciben, si es la primera recidiva o no.', 'Y de nuevo Simona, considera la invasión de la médula ósea como una crisis visceral y por lo tanto, ¿recomienda la quimioterapia o se puede usar un CDK4/6 en pacientes con cáncer de mama luminal y metastásico?', 'Bueno, creo que...', 'Es una pregunta interesante porque la mayoría de nuestras pacientes con metástasis óseas presentan invasión medular.', 'Así que lo que considero una crisis visceral es pancitopenia.', 'Una paciente viene con plaquetas de 65.', 'Esa es una crisis visceral y, de hecho, en la mayoría de esas pacientes, si ellas en realidad, es decir, una de mis pacientes actuales que desarrolló enfermedad metastásica después de múltiples líneas de tratamiento endocrino porque tuvo recidivas locales y progresó con fulvestrant y abemaciclib con pancitopenia.', 'Y es interesante, no se puede ver el cáncer tan bien en las imágenes pero las plaquetas cayeron a 65 000 y presenta anemia dependiente de transfusiones.', 'Y en ese caso, realmente opino que solo la quimioterapia puede cambiar la situación.', 'Y lo que haré es empezar con una dosis muy baja de taxanos si puedo.', 'Esta paciente rechazó el taxano, así que le di capecitabina y estoy conteniendo la respiración para ver si sus recuentos de células suben.', 'Pero he administrado dosis muy bajas de taxanos en este contexto y he tenido pacientes recuperadas.', 'Pero entonces, lo que hago es detener la quimio y no en esta paciente que mencioné.', 'Tiene una enfermedad con resistencia endocrina.', 'Pero en otras pacientes, si es una paciente que todavía tiene sensibilidad endocrina, comenzaría el tratamiento endocrino después de conseguir que los recuentos se normalicen y lo intentaría y lo usaría como un descanso de la quimioterapia.', 'Sí, creo que un colega mío tiene una paciente que está respondiendo muy bien a la quimioterapia metronómica, es decir, capecitabina y porque ella no quería una dosis completa.', 'Así que creo que, en general, es una situación muy difícil de manejar.', 'Se desarrollan con mucha rapidez y progresan con mucha rapidez.', 'A ver, creo que aún tenemos un par de minutos para hacer preguntas.', 'Y solo por...', 'Hay una en el chat.', 'Ha entrado una nueva en el chat, Olivia.', 'Ah, hemos recibido una, bien.', 'Elena, sí, lo siento.', 'Para el cáncer de mama metastásico con positividad de HER2 con metástasis encefálicas, ¿qué recomienda como segunda línea si el trastuzumab deruxtecán no está aprobado o disponible?', 'Bueno, de hecho, en esta situación, si tienes todos los fármacos disponibles, usaríamos tucatinib, capecitabina y trastuzumab como segunda línea debido a los beneficios en la supervivencia global tan sorprendentes observados en pacientes con metástasis encefálicas.', 'Creo que T-DXd si lo tienes no sería una mala opción, pero creo que la mayoría de nosotros usaría tucatinib en ese contexto.', 'Y si hay una pequeña metástasis cerebral que está progresando, no importa mucho.', 'Si hay una gran cantidad de ellas y hay que irradiar el encéfalo completo o si ya han recibido radiación con cierta progresión menor, se consideraría, se considera el régimen de tucatinib HER2CLIMB.', 'Ahora, digamos que no tienes ninguno de estos fármacos nuevos tan caros y el tucatinib es bastante caro a pesar de ser un comprimido, y muy difícil para las pacientes que no tienen cobertura total del seguro.', 'Y si el trastuzumab deruxtecán no está aprobado.', 'El T-DM1 de hecho ha demostrado beneficios en metástasis encefálicas.', 'O sea, sin duda se ve una reducción.', 'Si es una paciente que tiene metástasis encefálicas en progresión en la segunda línea, se podría considerar el neratinib y la capecitabina donde hubo datos del ensayo NALA que demostraban cierta reducción.', 'Lo mostré en uno de mis resúmenes y también en los datos combinados donde se vio un control de la enfermedad más prolongado en pacientes con metástasis encefálicas tratadas y controladas.', 'Entonces, esta sería una opción.', 'Pero repito, creo que incluso la capecitabina con trastuzumab no es una opción poco razonable si una paciente ya ha recibido T-DM1 y no se dispone de ninguno de los otros fármacos.', 'El lapatinib también demostró beneficios en las metástasis encefálicas, pero es el más débil de los inhibidores orales de tirosina-cinasas que bloquean HER2 y la TFGe.', 'Así que usaría neratinib antes del lapatinib, si no pudiera, solo reduciría la dosis, usaría un esquema de aumento escalonado de dosis y usaría la dosis más baja posible para evitar mucha diarrea.', 'Y solo para completar esto.', '¿Cree que al menos en la enfermedad HER2+, dados los beneficios de estos fármacos, cambiaría la recomendación de no cribar las metástasis encefálicas?', '¿O cree que deberíamos revisar nuestra recomendación, al menos en la enfermedad HER2+?', 'Sí, saben, acabo de mencionar esto donde tenemos algunos casos para presentar en una conferencia local y la persona que los preparó, dijo: «Sabe, de verdad que debería hacer esta pregunta porque creo que la gente está cambiando».', 'Aunque nuestras directrices aún no recomiendan hacer pruebas de imagen cerebral de cribado y el grupo de Consenso para el Cáncer de Mama Avanzado no lo recomendó, hubo mucha gente que votó a favor.', 'Así que no hubo en modo alguno un acuerdo universal.', 'Y creo que debido a que ahora tenemos tratamiento y que a veces se ve una enfermedad muy muy mala donde la gente tiene muchos síntomas y hay que irradiar un área mucho más grande.', 'Creo que estamos cambiando hacia resonancias cerebrales de cribado periódicas.', 'La cuestión es que no tenemos idea de con qué frecuencia hacerlo y qué hacer, así que todavía estamos un poco perdidos en esa área.', 'Sin embargo, creo haber visto alguna disfunción cognitiva muy significativa en las pacientes con el tiempo y la necrosis por radiación, que es un problema enorme, enorme, un área enorme para abordar.', 'Si estuviéramos dando una charla sobre metástasis encefálicas, hablaríamos también de la necrosis por radiación porque es un tema muy importante que te quita el sueño.', 'Pero en esas pacientes, si solo irradiáramos áreas más pequeñas, tal vez, tendríamos menos toxicidad.', 'Así que esa es la, creo, las áreas a las que todavía tenemos que responder pero tal vez deberíamos hacer el cribado en algunas pacientes.', 'Bueno, creo que no hay más preguntas, tal vez, solo un comentario porque acabas de tocar quizás, creo que es importante sobre los inhibidores de PARP en pacientes con mutación BRCA.', 'Entonces, tal vez solo hacer un resumen sobre el manejo de estas mujeres de acuerdo con su subtipo porque creo que esto también es importante.', 'Sí, creo que es muy importante, y creo que nosotros, probablemente no me quita tanto el sueño porque es un pequeño porcentaje de nuestra población.', 'Así que no las incluí aquí.', 'Y, por supuesto, las cosas de las que se puede hablar son limitadas.', 'Pero si es tan importante que las pacientes se hayan hecho pruebas de BRCA en la línea germinal.', 'Y si las vas a hacer, si una paciente viene y no se ha hecho una prueba de BRCA en la línea germinal, puedes hacer la secuenciación de última generación, que es algo que ibas a hacer de todos modos para el cáncer y obtendrás la mutación.', 'Y entonces, puedes volver atrás y hacer pruebas de la línea germinal.', 'O sea, frotis de la mucosa o si la cuestión económica sigue siendo un problema, se las puede tratar como BRCA+ porque tenemos datos que sugieren que incluso para las mutaciones somáticas, vemos respuestas con inhibidores de la PARP.', 'Y luego, creo que otra cuestión que surge es qué pasa con una paciente con la mutación PALB2.', 'Vemos esto en la enfermedad triple negativa así como en la enfermedad con positividad para receptores hormonales.', 'Y en ese grupo de pacientes, ¿cómo decidiríamos sobre los inhibidores de la PARP?', 'Y hemos visto datos escasos pero muy alentadores de que estos cánceres también responden a la inhibición de la PARP.', 'Entonces, en mi opinión lo que creo es que si pudieras administrarlo, lo intentamos y lo administramos.', 'Se puede conseguir el uso compasivo a través de las empresas que fabrican inhibidores de la PARP si el medicamento no está aprobado en su país, en gran medida, no siempre, pero a veces, por ejemplo si una paciente tiene una mutación PALB2 o una mutación somática.', 'Y luego, la otra pregunta es ¿cuándo se debe administrar el inhibidor de la PARP con el otro tratamiento?', 'Y creo que en el caso de los inhibidores de CDK4/6, creemos que se les debe administrar primero antes que el inhibidor de la PARP porque hemos visto estos beneficios en la supervivencia.', 'O sea, es bien tolerado en la mayoría de las pacientes.', 'Y el inhibidor de la PARP sería la segunda línea.', 'Sin embargo, en la enfermedad triple negativa, simplemente no tenemos grandes opciones para las pacientes que son PD-L1–, que son la mayoría de nuestras pacientes.', 'Así que, si una paciente pudiera recibir un inhibidor de la PARP como primera línea, yo lo elegiría porque creo que depende del volumen de enfermedad que tenga y de si tiene crisis visceral.', 'Pero también, aunque de nuevo es una indicación no autorizada, usaría un inhibidor de la PARP como tratamiento de mantenimiento en pacientes que responden a la quimioterapia si tienes que empezar con quimioterapia.', 'Porque creo que cuanto antes le des el inhibidor de la PARP, más tiempo permanecerá la paciente y potencialmente esas pacientes pueden obtener un beneficio en la supervivencia en un análisis de subgrupos no planeado del ensayo OlympiA.', 'Entonces, creo que aquí el escenario se volverá más y más complejo porque tendremos inhibidores de la PARP adyuvantes, es como la CDK4/6.', 'Así que creo que será cada vez más complicado y vamos a probar cada vez más.', 'Y bueno, esta población de pacientes aumentará con el tiempo.', 'Por tanto creo que tenemos que estar preparados.', 'Además...', 'Solo tenemos una paciente que estaba en un ensayo y recibió un inhibidor de CDK4/6 en el estadio incipiente.', 'Y recibió palbo, así que se le podría haber administrado otro inhibidor de CDK4/6.', 'Ella no recayó durante el tratamiento.', 'Fue después de dejarlo.', 'Pero tiene una mutación BRCA2 y tenía en hueso y pleura.', 'Así que empecé a darle olaparib y todavía lo está recibiendo.', 'Lleva unos siete meses de tratamiento.', 'Por tanto, realmente es una gran opción que considerar.', 'Solo hay que individualizar.', 'Además, tendemos a dar carboplatino cada vez más a pacientes triple negativas.', 'Y si son BRCA+, no tenemos datos de los inhibidores de la PARP después de los compuestos con platino.', 'Así que creo que hay muchas cosas que se superponen y no podemos tener respuestas para ello y nunca las tendremos tampoco de los ensayos clínicos.', 'Y bien, creo que nos estamos quedando sin tiempo.', 'Creo que ha sido realmente muy útil.', 'Así que la próxima vez, volveremos a pedirle que participe en esta charla, Hope, porque creo que ha sido muy interesante y estimulante, y muchas gracias.', 'Muchas gracias, y gracias a todos ustedes que nos están escuchando y por sus interesantes preguntas.', 'Gracias.', 'Hasta pronto.', 'Adiós.']\n",

Los que tienen riesgo, están incluidos en la alta dosis de radioterapia.', 'what in modulation of radiotherapy does it can repair the organ at risk especially those which are located inside the target volume', 'we can all model the dose on the tube keeping the last dose where we want to eradicate microscopic tumor cells and higher dosing in in where the tumor is present', 'Está bien.', 'La segunda cosa es esta.', 'Este es el y muchos guiados radioterapia.', 'ah nowadays we have available in our department these machines with our more and more spread around the world which is an hybrid machine in which we have a leader accelerator together with a mri', 'Es llamada emeryline.

With long-course of chemo- radiotherapy, followed by surgery in four to six weeks.', 'The overall survival, disease-free survival, and local recurrence at four years were similar between the two groups.', 'However, patients who received the long- course had higher pathologic complete response, with 16% versus 0.7%.', 'Also, the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group compared preoperatively short-course of radiotherapy and long-course of chemo- radiotherapy in patients with T3 tumours.', 'No significant difference in oncology outcomes were reported, but patients with short-course of radiotherapy had a higher rate of local recurrence with 7% versus 4%, and lower rate of pathologic complete response, with 1% versus 15%.', 'At this point, we have one more question.', 'What is the prognosis by lieu of pathologic complete response?', 'A meta-analysis identified 27 articles based on 17 different data sets for long-term outcomes of patients with and without pathologic complete response.', 'Primary outcome was five-year disease-free survival, and it was 83% for patients with pathologic complete response versus 65% for patients without pathologic complete response.', 'Also, they have better long-term outcome, like locoregional recurrence, distant recurrence, and overall survival.', 'It might be indicative of pathologic complete response a prognosis of favourable factor in local advanced rectal cancer.', 'But what happens if we delay surgery?', 'Optimal dosing and time to surgery were investigated in the Stockholm III non- inferiority trial.', '840 patients with resectable rectal cancer were divided in three groups.', 'Short-course of chemo-radiotherapy with immediate surgery, short-course of chemo-radiotherapy with surgery four to six weeks later, and long-course of chemo-radiotherapy.', \"This outcome didn't interfere between the two groups, but patients who underwent short-course of radiotherapy with delayed surgery, had a lower rate of post- operative complications, greater tumour regression, and a higher rate of pathologic complete percent, with 11% versus 1%, than patients with immediate surgery.\", 'Therefore, short-course of radiotherapy with delayed surgery is a viable alternative to long-course of chemo-radiotherapy.', 'But what happened about chemotherapy?', 'The Polish trial evaluated short-course of radiotherapy and consolidation of chemotherapy versus chemo-radiation with fluorouracil and oxaliplatin in rectal cancers with clinical T4 or 3.', 'With a median follow-up of seven years, there was no difference in local and distant recurrence, disease-free-survival and overall survival.', 'But, the group of short-course has less acute toxicity with similar pathologic complete response and proficient surgery.', 'With a benefit of chemotherapy in adjuvant setting, do all patients need radiation?', 'The phase II PROSPECT trial is currently investigating selective radiotherapy in patients with intermediate-risk who are eligible for a sphincter-preserving treatment.', 'In the selective arm, patients received six cycles of neoadjuvant FOLFOX, followed with the responsible regimen with proctoscopy and magnetic resonance.', 'Those with more than 20%, then surgery, patients with less than 20% received chemo- radiotherapy concurrent, and surgery.', 'The data is awaiting validation, but is a promising study.', 'Okay, at this point, the concept of total neoadjuvant therapy arrived.', 'Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can be given either before chemo-radiotherapy as induction treatment, or after as consolidation, but both prior to surgical resection.', 'These studies have outlined the effectiveness of chemotherapy in different time.', 'The Spanish III, a phase II trial, which compared induction chemotherapy versus long-course of chemo-radiotherapy, the results showed no significant difference in disease outcomes, but a lower toxicity and improved compliance of treatment with induction are compared with the adjuvant chemotherapy were reported.', 'On the other hand, the use of consolidation chemotherapy was explored in this multi-centre trial conducted by Garcia- Aguilar.', 'There were four arms.', 'The group one had total mesorectal excision six to eight weeks after chemo- radiation.', 'Groups two to four received two, four or six cycles of FOLFOX respectively between chemo- radiation, and total mesorectal excision.', 'They demonstrated good tolerance and significantly higher pathologic complete response in patients who received chemotherapy, with 38% for patients who received six cycles of FOLFOX.', 'No difference in a sphincter saving surgery, R0 resection, technical difficulty, and grade 3-4 operative complications were reported.', 'So, what is the optimal sequence of chemotherapy before or after concurrence?', 'In the CAO/ ARO phase II trial, patients with a stage 2 or 3 were assigned to group A for induction chemotherapy, or to group B for consolidation chemotherapy after concurrence with FOLFOX.', 'Primary endpoint was pathologic complete response.', 'In the intention-to-treat population, pathologic complete response was achieved in 17% in group A, and in 25% in group B, which is significantly higher for group B. Also, less grade 3-4 toxicities and better compliance during concurrence were reported for this group.', 'However, we have to emphasise that the time delay for surgery in group B was the double than in group A. In ESCO 2020, Rapido phase III trial was presented.', '920 patients with high-risk of rectal cancer where randomized to either short-course of radiotherapy followed with vast systemic consolidation with six cycles of CAPOX, or nine cycles of FOLFOX and TME surgery versus traditional long-concurrence, followed with the TME surgery.', 'The primary endpoint was three-year disease-related treatment failure, defined as first occurrence of locoregional failure, distant metastases, new primary colorectal tumour, or treatment-related death.', 'Disease-related death failure was 23% in the experimental group, versus 30% in the control-arm with a significant difference.', 'Also, patients in the TNT arm achieve a higher pathologic complete response with 28% versus 14% and a lower three-year rate of distant recurrence with 20% versus 27%.', 'The Prodige-23 phase III multi-centred trial, randomized 461 patients into arms, to either six cycles of FOLFIRINOX followed by chemo-radiation, surgery, and three months of adjuvant chemotherapy or adjuvant chemo-radiation followed by surgery and six months of adjuvant chemotherapy.', 'Primary endpoint was three-year disease- free survival.', 'Patients in the TNT arm had a higher rate of pathologic complete response with 28% versus 12%, higher rate of disease-free survival at three years with 76% versus 69%, unless distant recurrence, with 21% versus 28%.', 'No difference in local recurrence or overall survival were reported.', 'In conclusion, the ability to reduce the risk of systemic recurrence, the increased rates of pathologic and clinical complete response with TNT have opened opportunities in selected patients.', 'Finally, based in patients with pathologic complete response have excellent oncologic outcomes.', 'Can surgery be avoided in patients with no clinical evidence of disease following adjuvant therapy?', \"The Watch-and-Wait has been studied most extensively by Dr Habr- Gama's group in Sao Paulo.\", 'They reported that patients with resectable distal rectal cancer were offered a strict surveillance if they had complete clinical response based on magnetic resonance and endoscopy one- year after completion of chemo-radiotherapy.', 'Complete clinical response was found in 27% of patients, and those patients were able to avoid TME.', 'Locoregional recurrence was found in 25% of those patients, all of one underwent successful salvaged surgery.', 'Other studies demonstrate high-rates of rectum preservation and successful salvage of local recurrence, but they were admitted by a small sample size, the heterogeneity of the study populations, and relatively short follow-up.', 'Herein, we show a retrospective analysis of an international database of about 1000 rectal cancer patients managed with Watch-and-Wait approach.', 'With similar report, 25% of patients had a local regrowth after a median follow-up of three-years, and only 8% of patients presented distant recurrence.', 'What is more, 88% of recurrences were diagnosed within the first two years.', 'And 97% was located in the bowel wall.', 'Accordingly, surgical resection may be avoided in some patients.', 'The final message, multidisciplinary management is essential.', 'Pathologic complete response is now a prognostic factor.', 'Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is now validated in local advanced rectal cancer.', 'TNT approach offers an improvement in the rate of pathologic complete response, and treatment has been selected accordingly with risk factors of the patients.', \"That's all.\", 'Thank you.', 'Thank you very much, Katia.', \"It was a very nice overview of the Medical Oncologist's role in rectal cancer.\", 'Dr Zahel Lakkis, our surgeon that is also participating in this section here, will have the opportunity to comment in the end.', 'I would like to ask now Professor Gambacorta from Rome, Italy, a city which I like very much, and I have been there 10 times, so, to talk about the Radiation Oncologist overview.', 'Okay.', 'Thank you very much, Dr Bezerra, and thank you very much, Katia Roque Perez, for this very nice presentation.', \"So, I'm just going to point out some aspects of the radiotherapy treatment.\", \"So, we know right now that the standard treatment to cure rectal cancer, they're presented by the TME surgery, okay.\", 'And radiotherapy and chemotherapy can be delivered before or after surgery, trying to improve oncological outcomes and to improve also quality of life.', 'As Dr Perez showed us, we have two main ways to deliver radiotherapy, which is the short-course followed by immediate surgery, with surgery delivered in the week after the end of radiotherapy, which lasts five days And it is finished in one week, and long-course chemo-radiation, where you use smaller daily dose of radiotherapy delivered in five weeks to a dose between 45 and 50, together with concomitant chemotherapy, and then you have to wait between six to eight weeks before delivering surgery.', 'So, this was the topic of the so-called the first-generation study.', 'This first- generation study was started with short-course, it was compared with surgery alone, and where long-course pre-operative chemo-radiation was compared with post-operative chemo-radiation, or pre-operative radiotherapy.', 'The aim was to see if there was an increase on long-term outcomes, and the trial that radiotherapy or chemo-radiation compared to radiotherapy alone, increased the rate of local control.', 'However, they did not increase the disease-free survival or overall survival, except in two trials.', 'The first one is the Swedish trial, which was a trial in which surgery was delivered without total mesorectal excision.', 'So, it was before the introduction of total mesorectal excision, and the second is the Dutch trial, which is a trial which was conducted in patients with unresectable tumours.', 'So, the first take home-message is that pre- operative radiotherapy or pre-operative chemo-radiation delivered together with surgery, which is the corrective treatment in rectal cancer, increase the local control.', 'The other thing I wanted to say, going back to the previous slide is that with the short-course radiotherapy followed by immediate surgery, you can obtain an increased local control, whereas we deliver pre-operative chemo-radiation followed by delayed surgery for two reasons.', 'The first one is because you intensify, and the second one is because you wait for the down-staging of the tumour, you also can achieve a down-staging.', 'And down-staging, it is important for two reasons.', 'First of all, is to improve the outcomes of the patients, in fact, you know, that a tumour in the mesorectal fascia or when you have positive resection margins after surgery, these may decrease long-term outcomes in terms of local recurrence, metastases, and overall survival.', 'So, you know that when you deliver pre-operative chemo-radiation, we delay surgery.', 'You obtain down-staging [and downsizing of] the tumour which moves from the mesorectal fascia.', 'So, in that case, we can obtain more resection with negative circumferential resection margin.', 'And this may improve the local control, may decrease the distant metastases, and may improve the overall survival.', 'And this was demonstrated in the Swedish trial.', 'This is a focus on the Swedish trial, which was a trial in where there was an increase of local control, distant metastases, and cancer specific survival for those patients who received chemo-radiation therapy, [compared to those who received preoperative radiotherapy alone], who obtained a higher rate of R0 resection.', 'So, pre-operative chemo-radiation by providing down-staging of the tumour, give the possibility to have a higher R0 resection and long-term outcomes.', 'Not only local control, but also distant metastases.', 'On the other hand, if we think to this first-generation trial, you know that a tumour can shrink also in the length.', 'So, in the tumour length, and in the case the tumour moves away from the anorectal junction, the patients can receive a surgery with the preservation of their sphincter.', 'However, in randomised trials, [no advantage was demonstrated] in sphincter preservation in those patients who received pre-operative chemo-radiation.', 'But… if you have any question, please chat on the chat box.', 'But what happened with these studies? that we faced the pathological complete response.', 'So, we have seen that in a, which is around 20% in local advanced rectal cancer and may achieve 40% in earlier cancers.', 'So, early T3 tumours or T2 tumours, patients who achieve a pathological complete response and as Katia already showed in her presentation, patients who had a pathologic complete response to pre-operative chemo-radiation have also better long- term outcomes in terms of local control, distant metastases, disease-free, and overall survival.', 'So, the second-generation studies on pre-operative treatments, especially those studies with long-course chemo- radiation concentrated to intensified treatment.', 'How?', 'By the addition of oxaliplatin.', 'So, in 2000, we faced studies in which oxaliplatin was added to 5FU in pre-operative chemo-radiation with the aim to improve pCR, and also to improve DFS, disease-free survival.', 'As you can see, they failed to demonstrate the effect of oxaliplatin, except [two trials], the Chinese and especially the German trial, which has an increase of pCR, and also increase of DFS.', 'And they explained these results, either by less acute toxicity and better compliance of the patients.', 'So, they reduced the number of doses of oxaliplatin, and also, they reduced the dose of oxaliplatin delivered.', 'And by this method, they had less acute toxicity and better compliance of patients, and this resulted in better short-term and long-term outcomes.', 'This increase of pCR, since pCR means better long-term outcomes, led to put in place trials and nowadays, since 2015 up to now, we are facing a lot of trials which are trying to avoid surgery.', 'So, trials and organ preservation that can be done with a Watch-and- wait approach, or with a local excision.', 'And already, as Dr Perez showed, for example, for the Watch-and- Wait approach, we have very good results because, we know that of 20% of patients with complete response, 25% have a re-growth, but this re-growth is salvageable, and this salvage surgery leads to a very high-rate of overall survival and disease-free survival.', 'It has also been seen that patients with complete response have a very low rate of distance metastases, even though you have to be careful because patients with local regrowth may have a higher-risk of distant metastases compared to those patients who maintain a clinical complete response over time.', 'So, the idea is now how to increase the rate of patients with clinical complete response with complete response?', 'Is the chemotherapy intensification.', 'And as Dr Perez showed us, we are moving to the total neoadjuvant therapy, where we have seen that it seems to be better, the consolidation chemotherapy, so, chemotherapy after radiotherapy, than neoadjuvant chemotherapy.', 'So, it is better to consolidate instead of using chemotherapy before radiotherapy or chemo-radiation.', \"The second way to improve is the dose escalation, which was mentioned again by Dr Perez, was to increase the time between the end of radiotherapy and surgery and we're facing several trials also of chemo-radiation also moving from local advanced rectal cancer to early tumours.\", 'So, I will skip the chemotherapy intensification because Dr Perez already showed us a lot of results and we will move to the dose escalation in radiotherapy.', 'As a radiation oncologist, we know that the higher is the dose, the higher is the tumour response on one hand, and the higher and bigger is the volume of tumour, the higher is the dose that you have to deliver.', 'So, but which is the dose that we should deliver?', \"It's been seen that to obtain a complete response in 50% of patients you have to deliver really high doses up to 90 Gy.\", 'You have to think that nowadays the dose that we deliver in pre-operative radiotherapy of chemo-radiation, the standard is between 45 to 50 Gy.', \"In even more cases, we can arrive up to 55 Gy and now there are some trials arriving up to 60 Gy. it's more than 60 Gy.\", 'You can have a higher rate of pathological complete response with the same rate of acute toxicity.', 'And how we can improve the dose?', 'In two ways.', 'One way is called intensity modulated radiotherapy, I will show you later how it works, by which we can direct different doses to the targets according to the tumour burden, [So that] we can treat the volume where we think there are microscopic tumour cells with lower dose and at the same time we can deliver higher dose on what we call the GTV, the gross tumour volume, the macroscopic tumour, but we also achieve even higher doses by using local therapies, one of these is brachytherapy.', 'So, it is a radiotherapy technique where you put the source, the radiation source, with an applicator directly in contact with the tumour.', 'The contact therapy, which is a surface, a sort of surface radiotherapy, where you deliver very high doses of low energy x-rays, and you can remove the tumour layer by layer.', 'And with this technique, you have very few acute toxicities because you just irradiate the tumour, avoiding completely the normal tissues.', 'On the other hand, there is the time.', 'This is a meta-analysis that we have done on, I think, seven randomised trials run in Europe to measure the rate of pathological complete response.', 'According to time, we have seen that 95% of pCR appears after 10 weeks, and after the 16th week we have a plateau.', 'So, if you want to wait for a higher number of pCR you have to wait more than 10 weeks, this is the message after pre-operative chemo-radiation.', 'Then, I want to finish with the advances in radiotherapy.', \"So, I don't know if you, in the audience, I don't think that you are all Radiation Oncologists, but you know that when nowadays, Radiation Oncologists, when we talk about radiotherapy delivery, we talk about the intensity modulated radiotherapy, or volumetric modulated radiotherapy, which is a way to modulate, to decrease the dose to the organ at risk and to modulate the dose inside the different volumes that we irradiate.\", 'The second advance that we had was the on-board imaging.', 'You know, that we as Radiation Oncologists, we work with imaging because we have to point our rays on the target, so we have to work with images.', \"And nowadays, we have the possibility to see the tumour, we don't use imaging only for the planning, but we use the imaging also during the treatment.\", 'And I will show you, which are the on-board imaging that nowadays we have available on our machines to see the tumour while we irradiate it.', 'And the third one is, and this may help you, to adapt radiotherapy.', 'That means that we do not decide the radiation dose at the beginning of the treatment, but that we can modulate the dose according to the tumour response during the treatment, and I will use three examples.', 'The first one, this is what we call intensity modulated radiotherapy.', 'In the 3D radiotherapy the target volume is included is all included in the field, however part of the organs at risk, they are included in the high-dose of radiotherapy.', 'While in intensity modulation of radiotherapy dose, we can spare the organs at risk, especially those which are located inside the target volume.', 'We can modulate the dose on the tumours, giving less dose where we want to eradicate microscopic tumour cells and higher dosing where the tumour is present.', 'Okay?', 'The second thing is this one.', 'This is the image-guided radiotherapy.', 'Nowadays, we have available in our department this machine which are more and more spread around the world, which is a hybrid machine in which we have a linear accelerator together with an MRI.', 'It is called MRI-LINAC. By this, we can see the tumour during each [fraction] how it moves.', 'The blue line is if the tumour goes out of the blue one, the machine stops delivering the dose.', 'This means that you can spare the organ at risk and you can decrease the margin around the tumour.', 'Today, the patient can see where the tumour is.', 'So, especially not in the case of rectal cancer, but especially for those tumours, which are located in the liver or in the lung, they can control their breath to let the tumour stay inside the blue line.', 'And we also can see what happens through the treatment.', 'So, you can see, this is the tumour at the first week of treatment, second, third, fourth, fifth, and at the end of the treatment.', 'You can see that the tumour shrinks during the treatment.', 'Moreover, you know that nowadays we have radiomics.', \"Radiomics is a way to read quantitatively, I don't know how to say it, the MRI images.\", 'So, for example, in this case, looking at the shrinkage of the tumour and measuring radiomics at certain time, what we can do is that we can adapt the dose according to the prevision of the tumour response.', 'And this is a trial, it is a mono-centric trial phase II that we are running in our institution with this MRI_ LINAC, patients with rectal cancer, with intermediate- stage of rectal cancer.', 'So, T2, T2 N1, or T3 N0 N1, or T4 N0. [These patients] are treated with pre-operative chemo-radiation.', 'Then, at the second week, we go to measure volume and we do radiomics on the image, and we do the Delta radiomics between the start and the treatment at two weeks.', 'So, if we see that the tumour responds, we have a high chance of complete response.', 'If this is the case, the patient can continue with the dose they started at the beginning.', 'If we can, if our prevision is that the tumour will not achieve a complete response, we deliver a boost during the treatment, we arrive up to 60 Gy.', 'That means that we modulate the dose, according to the tumour response.', \"So, we adapt the treatment to the tumour's behaviour right during the treatment.\", \"So, that's just to say that my take-home message on the role of radiotherapy is that we know that radiotherapy nowadays increases local control, and as Katia showed, the complete response after chemo-radiation is related to better outcomes.\", 'And in those patients, we are trying to avoid surgery to improve quality of life.', 'And the way to increase the complete response is done by intensification, so TNT, or radiotherapy dose, or we may also increase the lag, the time between the end of pre-operative treatment and that from the Radiation Oncologists point of view, and that from the Radiation Oncologists point of view, I wanted to show you new technologies that may help us to according to tumour response.', 'So, thank you very much for your attention.', 'Thank you very much, Maria.', 'It was a very, very nice presentation.', \"I think we have a very good overview of how we can deal with rectal cancer's patients in a multi-disciplinary way.\", 'I would like to give the word to Professor Zahel Lakkis to understand a little bit his perception as a surgeon, how we can place chemo- radiation therapy before, after.', 'I would like to hear a little bit about your opinion regarding TNT strategies to treat patients.', 'So, please, give us your thoughts.', 'Thank you, Ramon.', 'First, I would like to congratulate both presentations because it was very, very good quality of slides.', 'And I learned a lot about new technologies in radiotherapy, so, thank you very much.', 'Before questions, maybe, I have just a comment.', 'Here in France, we have adopted the Prodige-23 trial.', 'In fact, very few centres use the Rapido protocol there are a lot of reasons, but as a surgeon, when now I have to explain to a patient that he will have to have three months of chemotherapy, then one month, five weeks of radiotherapy, then wait two months, then surgery, then he has to recover from surgery, then three months of chemotherapy, then, you have to close the stoma.', \"So, for more and more young patients especially, who have to support a TNT, we are talking about a one-year protocol in fact, and it's not a question, it's just a remark that in some cases it could be very difficult for the patients to stop any work, any social life almost.\", 'So, it was just my comment, but the results are very, very good.', 'In fact, we are improving the survival of the patient and now we have, and this is my really concern, my main concern, we have now almost 30% of complete response when we do a TME.', 'So, my question would be maybe for both, how could we now maybe avoid 30% of unnecessary TME in patients with T3 N0 or T2 N1 patients, should we still perform a TME for all patients with a suspicion of clinical complete response after TNT protocols?', 'What is your opinion about that?', \"Because I think that as a surgeon, I'm doing 30% of almost unnecessary surgeries.\", 'Maria and Katia, do you want to talk?', 'Go Katia, go Katia.', 'Okay.', 'In ESCO 2020, they presented the preliminary results of the trial, which is a phase III, evaluating a stage 2 or 3 rectal cancer, who received a total neoadjuvant and FOLFOX or CAPOX as induction or consolidation therapy, followed by watch-and-wait approach with one-year of follow-up.', 'We have now results, preliminary results, at two-years of follow-up, which show 58% of patients in the consolidation arm have a sphincter preservation.', 'And there are promising results, and we are waiting for more data.', 'But I think that watch-and-wait is a good alternative for patients with distal rectal cancer and very young patients, which quality of life is a priority to develop.', 'Maria, what do you think?', 'I agree, because there is 30% of patients who achieve a complete response, but on the other hand, there are 70% of patients who do not.', 'So, these patients receive very long, long treatment and then at the end, they finish to have a TME, so, we have to consider both.', 'What is, in my opinion, is that we have to pursue we have to, in case the question of Dr Lakkis was, in these patients with complete response, do we have to avoid TME?', 'I think, yes.', \"However, I think that we should, nowadays, we don't have a real tool to preview which will be the patients who will respond.\", 'So, this is the way we have to go I think, in the future.', 'So, prediction model, trying to predict who will respond and who will not, because in this case, we can select those patients who will respond and select those patients who will never respond.', 'And in this case, they could directly go to a TME with better functional outcome compared to those patients who receive pre- operative treatment plus TME, together with a long time of treatment.', 'You know?', 'So, I think that the way to go is, to go for a prediction model to try to better select those patients who may be treated with radiotherapy alone, radiotherapy or chemo-radiation, on radiotherapy and chemotherapy to avoid surgery, and those patients in which avoiding all these treatments and go directly to TME because in some T3 N0 patients, TME is enough and they will have also good results, especially those in the mid rectum, or in the high rectum.', 'Yeah.', 'Yeah.', 'I totally agree with you.', 'I think we can be less harmful for the patients and possibly try to predict what kind of response they will have; it will help to get these better decisions in the future.', \"And maybe, if I can ask you one additional question, I don't know, in your experience, but in mine, we have more and more younger patients than 5, 10 or 15 years ago.\", \"And in my experience, I meet patients with tumours, with mucinous differentiation, and I have the feeling that those tumours don't have the same response with FOLFOX or FOLFIRINOX and even with chemo-radiotherapy, and these patients are the younger, we intensify the treatments, but those tumours are really in bad response.\", 'And do you think that we have to more and more intensify the treatments with increasing the dose of radiation?', 'Because those tumours for me, in my practice, are really, really problematic.', 'And I think that we are going to have more and more patients with these kinds of tumours.', \"I don't know why, maybe this is some behaviour changes in our diet, or what, but I think it's really, because those patients were not involved and enrolled in previous trials.\", '15, 20 years ago, those tumours were very rare.', 'And now, I have a feeling that we are confronting to more and more mucinous tumours.', 'To which kind of tumour are you referring?', 'Tumours with the colorectal differentiation mucinous.', 'Ah, the mucinous.', 'These mucinous tumours are very hard to treat.', 'Yes.', \"And they usually develop metastases very early and also in unpredictable places, I saw metastases in the skin, in the kidney, and I really don't know because usually those tumours with a lot of mucins, they do not, sometimes, they do not respond.\", \"Other times, they, you find they apparently do not respond, and then on the pathological specimen, you just see mucin and you don't see any tumour cells, but I agree completely with you, which is very difficult.\", 'It might be that these patients, since they develop metastases earlier, or in unpredicted places, they could be, it could be given a priority to chemotherapy.', \"I don't know.\", \"I don't know if Katia has an idea on how to treat these tumours.\", \"It's a very complicated to treat tumour.\", \"We don't have many cases, but the cases that we have usually with very bulky disease and advanced disease.\", \"Actually, mucinous is very, it's not so chemo-sensitive, and it brings us challenges to this type of approach.\", 'And so.', \"No, usually these tumours are, correct me if I'm wrong, Katia, these tumours have usually the mutation of BRAF, are BRAF mutated, from what is my experience.\", \"So, I don't know if in the future we will develop a molecule that goes against this tumour.\", 'I think that there are some Medical Oncologists, there are some studies in this way trying to select these patients by the mutational point of view.', 'Yes, I think.', 'All right.', 'I think our time end-up, I would like to congrats everyone that participated here in this multi-disciplinary section for rectal cancer, I think it was exciting to discuss with you several aspects of this disease.', 'That is very hard to treat as we saw here.', \"I'd like to congrats all the speakers, all the panel, here, Dr Perez, Prof Gambacorta, and Prof Lakkis for their participation here.\", 'And I wish you a very nice rest of day or night, depending on the part of the globe you are.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you.', 'Thank you.', 'Bye-bye.', 'Thank you.', 'Bye.']\n",
            "['Hola a todos.', 'Soy Ramón de Mello y estoy encantado de coordinar esta sesión multidisciplinaria sobre el cáncer rectal.', 'Hoy tenemos aquí expertos de todo el mundo que hablarán sobre multidisciplinariedad, ¿cómo podemos abordar mejor el cáncer rectal para mejorar los resultados?', 'Y tenemos dos expertas que harán una presentación, una oncóloga médica, la Dra. Katia Pérez, y una radiooncóloga, la profesora Maria Antonietta Gambacorta.', 'Así que empezaremos con la Dra. Katia Pérez, que nos dará una visión del oncólogo médico en el cáncer rectal y después, terminaremos con la profesora Gambacorta, que nos dará una visión del radiooncólogo en el tratamiento del cáncer rectal.', 'Y al final, estaremos abiertos a preguntas y a comentar lo consideren pertinente para esta sección.', 'Katia, por favor, adelante.', 'DRA. Buenas tardes, es un placer estar aquí hoy.', 'Y mi nombre es Katia Roque Pérez, y voy a presentar una revisión del manejo multidisciplinario del cáncer rectal.', 'Antes de 2020, existen dos tratamientos estándar diferentes para el cáncer rectal localmente avanzado, un ciclo corto de radioterapia o un ciclo largo de radioquimioterapia, seguidos de cirugía con EMT y quimioterapia adyuvante para pacientes con factores de riesgo.', 'Si bien este enfoque multimodal ha mejorado las tasas de recurrencia local, no ha tenido efectos significativos en las tasas de recurrencia a distancia o la supervivencia global.', 'Así es como surgen preguntas importantes acerca de los beneficios de cada componente del enfoque multimodal.', 'La primera, ¿cuál es el régimen óptimo para la radioterapia neoadyuvante, el ciclo corto o el ciclo largo?', 'En Polonia, Bujkio y colaboradores compararon el ciclo corto preoperatorio de radioterapia, seguido de cirugía en los siete días siguientes con un ciclo largo de radioquimioterapia, seguido de cirugía en cuatro a seis semanas.', 'La supervivencia global, la supervivencia sin enfermedad y la recurrencia local a los cuatro años fueron similares entre los dos grupos.', 'Sin embargo, los pacientes que recibieron el tratamiento de larga duración presentaron una respuesta patológica completa superior, del 16% frente al 0,7%.', 'Además, el Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology Group comparó la radioterapia preoperatoria de corta duración y la radioquimioterapia de larga duración en pacientes con tumores T3.', 'No se notificaron diferencias significativas en los resultados oncológicos, pero los pacientes con un ciclo corto de radioterapia presentaron una tasa mayor de recidiva local, con un 7% frente al 4%, y una tasa menor de respuesta patológica completa, con un 1% frente al 15%.', 'En este punto, surge una pregunta más.', '¿Cuál es el pronóstico en lugar de la respuesta patológica completa?', 'En un metanálisis se identificaron 27 artículos basados en 17 conjuntos de datos diferentes de resultados a largo plazo en pacientes con y sin respuesta patológica completa.', 'El criterio principal de valoración fue la supervivencia sin enfermedad a los cinco años, y fue del 83% para los pacientes con respuesta patológica completa frente al 65% para los pacientes sin respuesta patológica completa.', 'Además, tienen mejores resultados a largo plazo, como la recurrencia locorregional, la recurrencia a distancia, y la supervivencia global.', 'Podría ser indicativo de que la respuesta patológica completa es un pronóstico de factor favorable en el cáncer rectal localizado avanzado.', '¿Pero qué pasa si retrasamos la cirugía?', 'En el ensayo de ausencia de inferioridad Stockholm III se investigó la posología óptima y el tiempo hasta la cirugía.', '840 pacientes con cáncer rectal resecable se dividieron en tres grupos.', 'Ciclo corto de radioquimioterapia con cirugía inmediata, ciclo corto de radioquimioterapia con cirugía de cuatro a seis semanas después y ciclo largo de radioquimioterapia.', 'Este resultado no interfirió entre los dos grupos, sin embargo, los pacientes sometidos a un ciclo corto de radioterapia con cirugía diferida, tuvieron una tasa menor de complicaciones posoperatorias, mayor regresión tumoral y una tasa mayor de porcentaje completo patológico, con un 11% frente a un 1%, que los pacientes con cirugía inmediata.', 'Por lo tanto, un ciclo corto de radioterapia con cirugía diferida es una alternativa viable al ciclo largo de radioquimioterapia.', '¿Pero qué pasó con la quimioterapia?', 'El ensayo polaco evaluó el ciclo corto de radioterapia y la consolidación de la quimioterapia frente a la quimiorradiación con fluorouracilo y oxaliplatino en cánceres rectales con T4 o 3 clínicos.', 'Con una mediana de seguimiento de siete años, no hubo diferencias en cuanto a recurrencia local y a distancia, supervivencia sin enfermedad y supervivencia global.', 'Pero, el grupo de ciclo corto tiene menos toxicidad aguda con respuesta patológica completa similar y cirugía competente.', 'Con el beneficio de la quimioterapia como tratamiento adyuvante, ¿necesitan todos los pacientes radioterapia?', 'El ensayo de fase II PROSPECT está investigando actualmente la radioterapia selectiva en pacientes de riesgo intermedio que son candidatos a un tratamiento que preserva el esfínter.', 'En este grupo selectivo, los pacientes recibieron seis ciclos de FOLFOX como tratamiento neoadyuvante, seguido del régimen responsable con proctoscopia y resonancia magnética.', 'Aquellos con más del 20%, después cirugía, los pacientes con menos del 20% recibieron radioquimioterapia concomitante y cirugía.', 'Los datos están pendientes de validación, pero se trata de un estudio prometedor.', 'Bien, en este punto, llegó el concepto de tratamiento neoadyuvante total.', 'La quimioterapia neoadyuvante puede administrarse antes de la radioquimioterapia como tratamiento de inducción, o después como consolidación, pero ambos antes de la resección quirúrgica.', 'Estos estudios han descrito la eficacia de la quimioterapia en diferentes momentos.', 'En el estudio Spanish III, un ensayo de fase II, en el que se comparó la quimioterapia de inducción con el ciclo largo de radioquimioterapia, los resultados no revelaron diferencias significativas en los desenlaces de la enfermedad, pero se notificó una menor toxicidad y un mejor cumplimiento del tratamiento de inducción en comparación con la quimioterapia adyuvante.', 'Por otro lado, el uso de quimioterapia de consolidación se estudió en este ensayo multicéntrico realizado por García-Aguilar.', 'Había cuatro grupos.', 'El grupo uno se sometió a una escisión mesorrectal total entre seis y ocho semanas después de la quimiorradiación.', 'Los grupos dos a cuatro recibieron dos, cuatro o seis ciclos de FOLFOX respectivamente entre la quimiorradiación y la escisión mesorrectal total.', 'Demostraron buena tolerancia y una respuesta patológica completa significativamente superior en pacientes que recibieron quimioterapia, con un 38% en los pacientes que recibieron seis ciclos de FOLFOX.', 'No se notificaron diferencias en una cirugía con preservación del esfínter, resección R0, dificultad técnica y complicaciones operatorias grado 3-4.', 'Entonces, ¿cuál es la secuencia óptima de la quimioterapia antes o después de la administración conjunta?', 'En el ensayo de fase II CAO/ARO, los pacientes con estadio 2 o 3 fueron asignados al grupo A para recibir quimioterapia de inducción, o al grupo B para recibir quimioterapia de consolidación tras la administración conjunta con FOLFOX.', 'El criterio principal de valoración fue la respuesta patológica completa.', 'En la población por intención de tratar, se logró una respuesta patológica completa en el 17% de los pacientes del grupo A y en el 25% de los del grupo B, cifra significativamente mayor en el grupo B. Además, en este grupo se notificaron menos toxicidades de grado 3-4 y un mejor cumplimiento durante la administración simultánea.', 'Sin embargo, hay que destacar que el retraso en la cirugía del grupo B fue el doble que en el grupo A. En ESCO 2020 se presentó el ensayo Rápido de fase III.', 'Se aleatorizaron 920 pacientes con riesgo alto de cáncer rectal a un ciclo corto de radioterapia seguido de una vasta consolidación sistémica con seis ciclos de CAPOX, o nueve ciclos de FOLFOX y cirugía EMT frente a tratamiento conjunto tradicional de larga duración, seguido de cirugía EMT.', 'El criterio principal de valoración fue el fracaso terapéutico relacionado con la enfermedad a los tres años, definido como la primera aparición de fracaso locorregional, metástasis a distancia, nuevo tumor colorrectal primario o muerte relacionada con el tratamiento.', 'La muerte relacionada con la enfermedad fue del 23% en el grupo experimental, frente al 30% en el grupo de control, con una diferencia significativa.', 'Además, los pacientes del grupo de TNT alcanzan una respuesta patológica completa mayor con el 28% frente al 14% y una tasa menor de recidiva a distancia a los tres años con el 20% frente al 27%.', 'En el ensayo multicéntrico de fase III Prodige-23, se aleatorizaron 461 pacientes en dos grupos, a seis ciclos de FOLFIRINOX seguido de radioquimioterapia, cirugía y tres meses de quimioterapia adyuvante o radioquimioterapia adyuvante seguida de cirugía y seis meses de quimioterapia adyuvante.', 'El criterio principal de valoración fue la supervivencia sin enfermedad a los tres años.', 'Los pacientes del grupo de TNT tuvieron una tasa más alta de respuesta patológica completa con un 28% frente a un 12%, una tasa más alta de supervivencia sin enfermedad a los tres años con un 76% frente a un 69%, a menos que haya una recidiva a distancia, con un 21% frente a un 28%.', 'No se notificaron diferencias en la recurrencia local ni en la supervivencia global.', 'En conclusión, la capacidad de reducir el riesgo de recidiva sistémica, el aumento de las tasas de respuesta patológica y clínica completa con TNT han abierto oportunidades en determinados pacientes.', 'Finalmente, tomando como base los pacientes con respuesta patológica completa se tienen excelentes resultados oncológicos.', '¿Se puede evitar la cirugía en pacientes sin signos clínicos de enfermedad después del tratamiento adyuvante?', 'El enfoque «Observar y esperar» ha sido estudiado ampliamente por el grupo del Dr. Habr-Gama en Sao Paulo.', 'Refirieron que a los pacientes con cáncer rectal distal resecable se les ofreció una vigilancia estricta si presentaban respuesta clínica completa según la resonancia magnética y la endoscopia un año después de haber completado la radioquimioterapia.', 'Se observó una respuesta clínica completa en el 27% de los pacientes, que pudieron evitar la EMT.', 'Se encontró recurrencia locorregional en 25% de los pacientes, todos los cuales se sometieron a cirugía de rescate exitosa.', 'Otros estudios demuestran altas tasas de preservación rectal y recuperación exitosa de la recidiva local, pero fueron admitidos debido al pequeño tamaño de la muestra, la heterogeneidad de las poblaciones de estudio y el seguimiento relativamente corto.', 'En este trabajo se presenta un análisis retrospectivo de una base de datos internacional de alrededor de 1000 pacientes con cáncer rectal manejados con el enfoque «Observar y esperar».', 'Con una notificación similar, el 25% de los pacientes presentó recidiva local después de una mediana de seguimiento de tres años y tan solo el 8% presentó recidiva a distancia.', 'Además, el 88% de las recidivas se diagnosticaron en los dos primeros años.', 'El 97% estaban localizadas en la pared intestinal.', 'En consecuencia, la resección quirúrgica puede evitarse en algunos pacientes.', 'Como mensaje final, el manejo multidisciplinario es esencial.', 'La respuesta patológica completa es ahora un factor pronóstico.', 'La quimioterapia neoadyuvante está validada actualmente en el cáncer rectal local avanzado.', 'El abordaje con TNT ofrece una mejora en la tasa de respuesta patológica completa, y el tratamiento se ha seleccionado de acuerdo con los factores de riesgo de los pacientes.', 'Eso es todo.', 'Gracias.', 'Muchas gracias, Katia.', 'Ha sido un muy buen resumen general del papel del oncólogo médico en el cáncer rectal.', 'El Dr. Zahel Lakkis, nuestro cirujano que también está participando en esta sección, tendrá la oportunidad de comentar al final.', 'Me gustaría preguntar ahora a la profesora Gambacorta de Roma, Italia, una ciudad que me gusta mucho, y he estado allí 10 veces, para hablarnos resumidamente sobre el radiooncólogo.', 'Bien.', 'Muchas gracias, Dr. Bezerra, y muchas gracias, Katia Roque Pérez, por esta presentación tan interesante.', 'Y bien, solo voy a señalar algunos aspectos del tratamiento de radioterapia.', 'Ahora sabemos que el tratamiento estándar para curar el cáncer rectal, está representado por la cirugía de EMT.', 'Y la radioterapia y la quimioterapia se pueden administrar antes o después de la cirugía, intentando mejorar los resultados oncológicos y también la calidad de vida.', 'Como nos mostró la Dra. Pérez, tenemos dos maneras principales de administrar radioterapia, que es el ciclo corto seguido de cirugía inmediata, con cirugía practicada en la semana posterior al final de la radioterapia, que dura cinco días. Y se termina en una semana, y la radioquimioterapia de ciclo largo, donde se utiliza una dosis diaria más pequeña de radioterapia administrada en cinco semanas a una dosis de entre 45 y 50, junto con quimioterapia concomitante, y luego hay que esperar entre seis y ocho semanas antes de practicar la cirugía.', 'Así que este fue el tema del llamado estudio de primera generación.', 'Este estudio de primera generación se inició con un ciclo corto, se comparó con la cirugía sola y donde la radioquimioterapia preoperatoria de ciclo largo se comparó con la radioquimioterapia posoperatoria o la radioterapia preoperatoria.', 'El objetivo era ver si había un aumento en los resultados a largo plazo, y el ensayo que la radioterapia o la radioquimioterapia en comparación con la radioterapia sola, aumentó la tasa de control local.', 'Sin embargo, no aumentaron la supervivencia sin enfermedad ni la supervivencia global, excepto en dos ensayos.', 'El primero es el de Suecia, en el que se practicó cirugía sin escisión mesorrectal total.', 'Fue antes de la introducción de la escisión mesorrectal total, y el segundo es el ensayo holandés, que es un ensayo que se realizó en pacientes con tumores irresecables.', 'Entonces, el primer mensaje que quiero que recuerden es que la radioterapia preoperatoria o la radioquimioterapia preoperatoria administrada junto con la cirugía, que es el tratamiento correctivo en el cáncer rectal, aumentan el control local.', 'La otra cosa que quería decir, volviendo a la diapositiva anterior es que con la radioterapia de ciclo corto seguida de cirugía inmediata, se puede obtener un mayor control local, mientras que se administra quimiorradiación preoperatoria seguida de cirugía tardía por dos razones.', 'La primera es porque se intensifica, y la segunda es porque se espera a la reducción del tumor, también se puede lograr una reducción del estadio.', 'Y la reducción del estadio es importante por dos razones.', 'En primer lugar, es mejorar los resultados de los pacientes, de hecho, ya saben, que un tumor en la fascia mesorrectal o cuando tienes márgenes de resección positivos después de la cirugía, estos pueden disminuir los resultados a largo plazo en términos de recurrencia local, metástasis y supervivencia global.', 'Entonces, ya saben que cuando se administra radioquimioterapia pre-operatoria, retrasamos la cirugía.', 'Se consigue bajar la estadificación del tumor que se desplaza desde la fascia mesorrectal.', 'Así, en ese caso, podemos obtener más resección con margen de resección circunferencial negativo.', 'Esto puede mejorar el control local, disminuir las metástasis a distancia y mejorar la supervivencia global.', 'Y esto quedó demostrado en el ensayo sueco.', 'Este es un enfoque en el ensayo sueco, que fue un ensayo en el que hubo un aumento del control local, las metástasis a distancia, y la supervivencia específica del cáncer para aquellos pacientes que recibieron radioquimioterapia, [comparado con aquellos que recibieron radioterapia preoperatoria sola], que obtuvieron una tasa mayor de resección R0.', 'Por lo tanto, la quimiorradiación preoperatoria al proporcionar una bajada de la estadificación del tumor, permite tener una mayor resección R0 y resultados a largo plazo.', 'No sólo el control local, sino también las metástasis a distancia.', 'Por otro lado, si pensamos en este ensayo de primera generación, sabemos que un tumor puede reducirse también en su longitud.', 'Así, en la longitud del tumor, y en el caso de que el tumor se aleje de la unión anorrectal, los pacientes pueden someterse a cirugía con preservación del esfínter.', 'Sin embargo, en ensayos aleatorizados en la preservación del esfínter en aquellos pacientes que recibieron radioquimioterapia preoperatoria.', 'Pero... si tienen alguna pregunta, por favor escríbanla en el recuadro del chat.', 'Pero ¿qué pasó con estos estudios? que nos enfrentamos a la respuesta patológica completa.', 'Así pues, lo hemos visto en , que es de alrededor del 20% en el cáncer rectal local avanzado y puede alcanzar el 40% en cánceres más incipientes.', 'Así, los tumores T3 incipientes o tumores T2, los pacientes que logran una respuesta patológica completa y como Katia ya mostró en su presentación, los pacientes que tenían una respuesta patológica completa a la radioquimioterapia preoperatoria también tienen mejores resultados a largo plazo en términos de control local, metástasis a distancia, supervivencia sin enfermedad y supervivencia global.', 'Por lo tanto, los estudios de segunda generación sobre tratamientos preoperatorios, especialmente aquellos estudios con radioquimioterapia de ciclo largo se concentraron en el tratamiento intensificado.', '¿Cómo?', 'Mediante la adición de oxaliplatino.', 'Entonces, en el año 2000, nos enfrentamos a estudios en los que se añadió oxaliplatino a 5FU en la radioquimioterapia preoperatoria con el objetivo de mejorar la RPC, y también mejorar la SSE, la supervivencia sin enfermedad.', 'Como pueden ver, no pudieron demostrar el efecto del oxaliplatino, excepto , el ensayo chino y especialmente el alemán, que tiene un aumento de la RPC, y también un aumento de la SSE.', 'Y explicaron estos resultados, bien por una menor toxicidad aguda y un mejor cumplimiento de los pacientes.', 'Por lo tanto, redujeron el número de dosis de oxaliplatino, y también redujeron la dosis de oxaliplatino administrada.', 'Y con este método, tuvieron menos toxicidad aguda y mejor cumplimiento de los pacientes, y esto resultó en mejores resultados a corto y largo plazo.', 'Este aumento de la RPC, ya que la RPC supone mejores resultados a largo plazo, llevó a poner en marcha ensayos y hoy en día, desde 2015 hasta ahora, nos enfrentamos a una gran cantidad de ensayos que están intentando evitar la cirugía.', 'Así, los ensayos y la preservación de órganos que se pueden hacer con un enfoque de «Observar y esperar», o con una escisión local.', 'Y ya, como mostró la Dra. Pérez, por ejemplo, para el enfoque de «Esperar y observar», tenemos muy buenos resultados porque, sabemos que del 20% de los pacientes con respuesta completa, el 25% tienen una recidiva, pero esta recidiva es rescatable, y esta cirugía de rescate conduce a una tasa muy alta de supervivencia global y supervivencia sin enfermedad.', 'También se ha observado que los pacientes con respuesta completa tienen una tasa muy baja de metástasis a distancia, aunque haya que tener cuidado porque los pacientes con recidiva local pueden tener un mayor riesgo de metástasis a distancia en comparación con los pacientes que mantienen una respuesta clínica completa a lo largo del tiempo.', 'Entonces, la idea ahora es cómo aumentar la tasa de pacientes con respuesta clínica completa con respuesta completa.', 'Es la intensificación de la quimioterapia.', 'Y como la Dra. Pérez nos mostró, nos estamos moviendo hacia la terapia neoadyuvante total, donde hemos visto que parece ser mejor, la quimioterapia de consolidación, es decir, quimioterapia después de la radioterapia, que la quimioterapia neoadyuvante.', 'Por lo tanto, es mejor consolidar en lugar de utilizar quimioterapia antes de la radioterapia o la radioquimioterapia.', 'La segunda forma de mejorar es el aumento escalonado de la dosis, que mencionó de nuevo la Dra. Pérez, era aumentar el tiempo entre el final de la radioterapia y la cirugía y nos enfrentamos a varios ensayos también de radioquimioterapia que también cambian del cáncer rectal avanzado local a tumores incipientes.', 'Así que me saltaré la intensificación de la quimioterapia porque la Dra. Pérez ya nos mostró muchos resultados y pasaremos al aumento escalonado de dosis en radioterapia.', 'Como radiooncóloga, sabemos que cuanto mayor es la dosis, mayor es la respuesta del tumor por una parte, y cuanto más alto y mayor es el volumen del tumor, mayor es la dosis que hay que administrar.', 'Entonces, ¿cuál es la dosis que debemos administrar?', 'Se ha visto que para obtener una respuesta completa en el 50% de los pacientes hay que administrar dosis muy altas de hasta 90 Gy.', 'Hay que tener en cuenta que hoy en día la dosis que administramos en radioterapia preoperatoria de quimiorradiación, la norma es de 45 a 50 Gy.', 'En más casos, podemos llegar hasta los 55 Gy y ahora hay ensayos que llegan hasta los 60 Gy. son más de 60 Gy.', 'Puede tener una mayor tasa de respuesta patológica completa con la misma tasa de toxicidad aguda.', '¿Y cómo podemos mejorar la dosis?', 'De dos maneras.', 'Una forma es la llamada radioterapia de intensidad modulada, les mostraré más adelante cómo funciona, mediante la cual podemos dirigir diferentes dosis a las dianas de acuerdo a la carga tumoral, podamos tratar el volumen donde pensamos que hay células tumorales microscópicas con una dosis menor y al mismo tiempo podamos administrar una dosis mayor en lo que llamamos GTV, el volumen tumoral bruto, el tumor macroscópico, pero también logramos dosis aún mayores utilizando terapias locales, una de estas es la braquiterapia.', 'Es una técnica de radioterapia donde se pone la fuente, la fuente de radiación, con un aplicador directamente en contacto con el tumor.', 'La terapia de contacto, que es una superficie, una especie de radioterapia de superficie, donde se administran dosis muy altas de rayos X de baja energía, y se puede eliminar el tumor capa por capa.', 'Y con esta técnica, tienes muy pocas toxicidades agudas porque solo irradias el tumor, evitando completamente los tejidos normales.', 'Por otro lado, está el tiempo.', 'Este es un metanálisis que hemos hecho en, creo, siete ensayos aleatorizados realizados en Europa para medir la tasa de respuesta patológica completa.', 'Según el tiempo, hemos visto que el 95% de la RPC aparece después de 10 semanas, y después de la semana 16 tenemos una meseta.', 'Si quieren esperar a tener un mayor número de RPC deben esperar más de 10 semanas. Este es el mensaje después de la quimiorradiación preoperatoria.', 'Y bien, quiero terminar con los avances en radioterapia.', 'No sé si ustedes, en la audiencia, no creo que sean todos radiooncólogos, pero saben que cuando hoy en día, los radiooncólogos, cuando hablamos de la administración de radioterapia, hablamos de la intensidad de la radioterapia modulada, o radioterapia volumétrica modulada, que es una forma de modular, de disminuir la dosis al órgano en riesgo y modular la dosis dentro de los diferentes volúmenes que irradiamos.', 'El segundo avance que tuvimos fue la obtención de imágenes de a bordo.', 'O sea, como radiooncólogos, trabajamos con imágenes porque tenemos que apuntar los rayos a la diana, así que tenemos que trabajar con imágenes.', 'Y hoy en día, tenemos la posibilidad de ver el tumor, no usamos imágenes sólo para la planificación, sino que usamos la obtención de imágenes también durante el tratamiento.', 'Y les mostraré cuáles son las imágenes de a bordo que hoy tenemos disponibles en nuestras máquinas para ver el tumor mientras lo irradiamos.', 'Y la tercera es, y esto puede ayudarles, adaptar la radioterapia.', 'Eso significa que no decidimos la dosis de radiación al inicio del tratamiento, sino que podemos modular la dosis en función de la respuesta del tumor durante el tratamiento, y usaré tres ejemplos.', 'La primera es lo que llamamos radioterapia de intensidad modulada.', 'En la radioterapia 3D el volumen objetivo está incluido está todo incluido en el campo, sin embargo, parte de los órganos en riesgo, están incluidos en la dosis alta de radioterapia.', 'En la modulación de la intensidad de la dosis de radioterapia, podemos preservar los órganos en riesgo, especialmente aquellos que se encuentran dentro del volumen objetivo.', 'Podemos modular la dosis en los tumores, dando menos dosis donde queremos erradicar las células tumorales microscópicas y dosis más altas donde el tumor está presente.', '¿De acuerdo?', 'La segunda cosa es la siguiente.', 'Esta es la radioterapia guiada por imágenes.', 'Hoy en día, tenemos disponible en nuestro departamento esta máquina que está cada vez más extendida por el mundo, que es una máquina híbrida en la que tenemos un acelerador lineal junto con una resonancia magnética.', 'Se llama MRI-LINAC. Con esto, podemos ver el tumor durante cada cómo se mueve.', 'La línea azul es que si el tumor se sale del azul, la máquina deja de administrar la dosis.', 'Esto significa que se puede preservar el órgano en riesgo y disminuir el margen alrededor del tumor.', 'Hoy en día, el paciente puede ver dónde está el tumor.', 'Por lo tanto, especialmente no en el caso del cáncer rectal, pero especialmente para aquellos tumores, que se encuentran en el hígado o en el pulmón, pueden controlar su respiración para permitir que el tumor permanezca dentro de la línea azul.', 'Y también podemos ver lo que sucede a lo largo del tratamiento.', 'Como pueden ver, este es el tumor en la primera semana de tratamiento, la segunda, tercera, cuarta, quinta y al final del tratamiento.', 'Se puede ver que el tumor disminuye de tamaño durante el tratamiento.', 'Además, como saben hoy en día tenemos la radiómica.', 'La radiómica es una forma de leer cuantitativamente, no sé cómo se dice, las imágenes de RM.', 'Así, por ejemplo, en este caso, observando la reducción del tumor y midiendo la radiómica en determinado momento, lo que podemos hacer es adaptar la dosis de acuerdo con la previsión de la respuesta tumoral.', 'Y este es un ensayo, un ensayo monocéntrico de fase II que estamos llevando a cabo en nuestra institución con este MRI_LINAC, pacientes con cáncer rectal, con un estadio intermedio de cáncer rectal.', 'Así, T2, T2 N1, o T3 N0 N1, o T4 N0. reciben tratamiento con quimiorradiación preoperatoria.', 'Luego, en la segunda semana, vamos a medir el volumen y hacemos la radiómica en la imagen, y hacemos la radiómica delta entre el inicio y el tratamiento a las dos semanas.', 'Así que si vemos que el tumor responde, tenemos una alta probabilidad de respuesta completa.', 'Si este es el caso, el paciente puede continuar con la dosis inicial.', 'Si podemos, si nuestra previsión es que el tumor no va a alcanzar una respuesta completa, le damos un refuerzo durante el tratamiento, llegamos hasta los 60 Gy.', 'Eso significa que modulamos la dosis, según la respuesta del tumor.', 'Así que adaptamos el tratamiento al comportamiento del tumor justo durante el tratamiento.', 'Eso es solo para decir que el mensaje con el que deben quedarse acerca del papel de la radioterapia es que sabemos que la radioterapia hoy en día aumenta el control local, y como Katia nos mostró, la respuesta completa después de la quimiorradiación se relaciona con mejores resultados.', 'Y en esos pacientes tratamos de evitar la cirugía para mejorar la calidad de vida.', 'Y la forma de aumentar la respuesta completa es mediante la intensificación, es decir, TNT, o la dosis de radioterapia, o también podemos aumentar el desfase, el tiempo entre el final del tratamiento preoperatorio y que desde el punto de vista de los radiooncólogos, y que desde el punto de vista de los radiooncólogos, quería mostrarles nuevas tecnologías que pueden ayudarnos a mejorar de acuerdo con la respuesta del tumor.', 'Muchas gracias por su atención.', 'Muchas gracias, Maria.', 'Fue una presentación muy, muy interesante.', 'Creo que tenemos una muy buena visión general de cómo podemos tratar a los pacientes de cáncer rectal de una manera multidisciplinaria.', 'Me gustaría darle la palabra al profesor Zahel Lakkis para entender un poco su percepción como cirujano, cómo podemos colocar la radioquimioterapia antes, después.', 'Me gustaría conocer un poco su opinión sobre las estrategias de TNT para tratar a los pacientes.', 'Así que, por favor, denos su opinión.', 'Gracias, Ramon.', 'En primer lugar, me gustaría felicitar a ambas presentaciones porque fueron diapositivas de muy, muy buena calidad.', 'Y aprendí mucho sobre nuevas tecnologías en radioterapia, así que muchas gracias.', 'Antes de las preguntas, tal vez, solo tengo un comentario.', 'Aquí en Francia, hemos adoptado el ensayo Prodige-23.', 'De hecho, muy pocos centros usan el protocolo de Rápido por

positive hormone receptor negative breast cancer really is not the way that we would practice certainly not multidisciplinary but also not necessarily the ideal way we would practice now because after seeing the patient and discussing her in the back room we actually recommended a preoperative approach', 'she wanted breast preservation if possible and the preoperative approach or neoadjuvant systemic therapy was given because her is is recommended because her tumor is large and her two positive and erp are negative', 'Así que sabemos que va a recibir terapia sistémica.', \"she's going to get chemotherapy with anti-her two therapy because that's the standard approach\", 'um we would want to give it to her neo-adjuvantly to shrink down the tumor and potentially allow her to have breast conservation', 'other advantages are that in this day and age in the setting of her two positive breast cancer as well as with triple negative breast cancer now the response that a person might have to preoperative therapy can actually inform subsequent therapies', \"and i won't get into the details of that but certainly that is becoming a new standard of care in people with her two positive breast cancer based on recent and evolving data\", \"so giving her one treatment might either make it more clear that she needs a second treatment or it could make it clear that she doesn't need the second treatment after her preoperative therapy\", 'finally some other bennies of doing neoadjuvant therapy in this particular situation is that it might allow her the time to get the genetic testing see plastic surgery should she end up needing a mastectomy to consider optimal reconstruction options should she need that', 'and then finally you know we ended up offering her a clinical trial', 'so our current standard for preoperative anti-her two therapy is to do thp as it is for many especially in the developed world where these drugs are available', \"that's taxol herceptin and pertuzumab\",

planning to participate\", 'so for all those reasons both the multidisciplinary approach and then the plan to do neoadjuvant therapy in this particular patient really was the right thing to do oncologically', \"and i think without the multidisciplinary approach and especially at a place where we always do it so we know that that's the right thing to do oncologically um we were we were happy

outcomes potentially especially when it impacts on treatment decisions and treatment efficacy ultimately', 'this patient was also done having children otherwise she would have considered referral to reproductive endocrinology', 'and finally multidisciplinary care and decision making allows this to happen in a timely fashion', \"so when you're when you have a multidisciplinary clinic set up you can do this all together very quickly and everybody's ready\", \"that's not to say it's easy or that there aren't hoops to jump through and logistical issues for both the patients and the providers but when you're used to doing it and you know there's some growing pains at the beginning for sure we find that we can make it happen\", \"and that patient just came and saw me last week um she's getting her extra imaging and you know she had the the fine needle aspiration in the last few days and we're getting her set up for the study in this next week\", 'Así que nos vamos a poner en marcha.', 'Muy bien.', 'Y lo que le dijo la paciente y por qué está cambiando su atención a nosotros.', 'but she found it reassuring that her medical oncology and surgical oncology team were recommending the same approach and agreed that she would need to see a radiation oncologist if she preserved her breast or depending on her response to therapy and nodal involvement', 'She was also appreciating the convenience and timely approach to her care as she wanted to get treated treatment started as soon as possible.', 'and she was uncomfortable with the idea of going straight to the o r

alluded to there are a number of examples i could give ah why multidisciplinary care matters', \"i would also argue as a provider you know taking care of patients with breast cancer is challenging for the patient sometimes it can be emotional and having colleagues that you share a patient with and support them together makes it just so much more more i guess engaging and and not as difficult for both the patients and the providers because we're all sharing in the care of the patient\", '¿Compartirás en los buenos tiempos?', \"we're sharing in the bad times\", 'Um, another patient recently had

usually the way it works.\", 'And sometimes a radiation oncologist on the same day.', 'And so, she saw the surgeon first and her team.', 'And then she saw me with a fellow, along with a genetic counselor who followed us.', \"And we all talked in the back room before and after we've reviewed her records and seen the patient, while the patient is there, especially when things are not straightforward.\", 'But even when they are straightforward, we still do a pass off from the surgeon to me or vice versa.', \"The other nice thing about our multidisciplinary practice is we've been doing it for a number of years.\", \"So, the surgeon often knows what I'm gonna recommend, and even the studies I might think about, and vice versa.\", \"I know often what she's gonna recommend.\", \"We obviously always check it, and we talk to the patient, and say, I think she'll want to do this, but wait until she sees you, because, you know, I could be wrong, because we allow for that person from the discipline to use their expertise.\", \"So, we had reviewed her outside imaging together with radiology, prior to seeing the patient, and had our pathology reviewed by our pathologist's.\", \"Note the multidiscipline, those people aren't in the room.\", \"Now they're very virtual, but they had already seen her images and her pathology.\", 'And so, we were able to have that extra view.', 'And on imaging, we, actually, our radiologist saw another lesion in the same breast that had not been commented on by the outside hospital, and an MRI was actually recommended to determine whether these two areas were contiguous, which would have made her less likely to be able to have breast preservation upfront.', 'And, then, on imaging exam, even though all the documentation said that the tumor was two centimeters, on exam it was actually four centimeters, taking up a large proportion of her breast, and the subsequent MRI, that she got after she left us, a day or so later, actually, suggested that there was nodal involvement in the underarm, and the areas did appear to be contiguous in the breast.', \"The FNA was done to the node, and I actually don't know the results of that yet.\", 'But we were glad that she had seen us.', \"We saw that extra spot, we got the MRI, she's got a much larger breast cancer than the two centimeters she was billed as.\", 'And the idea of taking her straight to the OR with that size, potentially, node positive, HER2 positive, hormone receptor negative breast cancer really is not the way that we would practice, certainly not multidisciplinary, but also, not necessarily the ideal way we would practice now because after seeing the patient and discussing her in the back room, we actually recommended a preoperative approach.', \"She wanted breast preservation, if possible, and the preoperative approach or neoadjuvant systemic therapy was given because, it's recommended, because her tumor is large, and HER-2 positive and ER/ PR negative.\", \"So, we know she's gonna get systemic therapy.\", \"She's gonna get chemotherapy with anti-HER2 therapy, because that's the standard approach.\", 'And we would want to give it to her neoadjuvantly to shrink down the tumor and potentially allow her to have breast conservation.', 'Other advantages are that, in this day and age, in the setting of HER2 positive breast cancer, as well as with triple negative breast cancer now, the response that a person might have to preoperative therapy can actually inform subsequent therapies.', \"And I won't get into the details of that, but certainly, that is becoming a new standard of care in people with HER2 positive breast cancer based on recent and evolving data.\", \"So, giving her one treatment might either make it clearer that she needs a second treatment, or it could make it clear that she doesn't need the second treatment after her preoperative therapy.\", 'Finally, some other bennies of doing neoadjuvant therapy in this particular situation, is that it might allow her the time to get the genetic testing, see plastic surgery, should she end up needing a mastectomy, to consider optimal reconstruction options, should she need that.', 'And, then, finally, you know, we ended up offering her a clinical trial.', 'So, our current standard for preoperative anti- HER2 therapy is to do THP, as it is for many, especially, in the developed world, where these drugs are available.', \"That's Taxol, Herceptin, and Pertuzumab.\", \"And we have a study that's testing Taxol, and Margetuximab, and Pertuzumab.\", 'And so, we are supporting her to participate in that trial.', \"And it felt like a good fit, so she's actually planning to participate.\", 'So, for all those reasons, both the multidisciplinary approach, and then the plan to do neoadjuvant therapy in this particular patient really was the right thing to do oncologically.', \"And I think without the multidisciplinary approach, and especially at a place where we always do it so we know that that's the right thing to do oncologically, we were happy for this lady that she came down for a second opinion, and she actually transferred her care, even though she lives pretty far away.\", 'We also referred her to social work, because she has children, and wanted to kind of talk to them about how to better speak with her children and to support her partner.', \"We referred her to our nursing colleagues, because she's going to get chemotherapy, that would make her lose her hair, the taxane.\", 'And so, we are getting her fitted for scalp cooling.', 'And she was also enrolled in our ancillary specialized program for young women.', 'So, a real multidisciplinary approach, which we believe improves how women both feel through their treatment, the confidence they have in their care and their decisions, as well as, ultimately, their outcomes potentially, especially when it impacts on treatment decisions and treatment efficacy, ultimately.', 'This patient was also done having children, otherwise she would have considered referral to reproductive endocrinology.', 'And, finally, multidisciplinary care and decision-making allows this to happen in a timely fashion.', \"So, when you have a multidisciplinary clinic set up, you can do this all together very quickly and everybody's ready.\", \"That's not to say it's easy, or that there aren't hoops to jump through, and logistical issues for both the patients and the providers, but when you're used to doing it, and, you know, there's some growing pains at the beginning, for sure, we find that we can make it happen.\", \"And that patient just came and saw me last week, she's getting her extra imaging, and, you know, she had the fine needle aspiration in the last few days, and we're getting her set up for the study in this next week.\", \"So, we'll get her started soon.\", 'All right.', 'And what did the patient tell us and why is she switching her care to us?', 'Well, she found that reassuring that her medical oncology and surgical oncology team were recommending the same approach, and agreed that she would need to see a radiation oncologist if she preserved her breast, or depending on her response to therapy and nodal involvement.', 'She was also appreciating the convenience and timely approach to her care, as she wanted to get treated, treatment started as soon as possible.', 'And she was uncomfortable with the idea of going straight to the OR even herself when she had seen the surgeon initially.', 'So, you know, really a win-win for multidisciplinary care and for the patient, ultimately.', \"So, I'll conclude there.\", 'And as I alluded to, there are a number of examples I could give why multidisciplinary care matters.', \"I would also argue, as a provider, you know, taking care of patients with breast cancer is challenging for the patients, sometimes it can be emotional, and having colleagues that you share a patient with and support them together, makes it just so much more, I guess, engaging, and not as difficult for both the patient and the providers, because we're all sharing in the care of the patient.\", \"We're sharing in the good times.\", \"We're sharing in the bad times.\", 'Another patient recently had a PCR, a complete pathologic response to preoperative therapy in our practice.', 'And we found out from pathology, and the emails going around were, \" Yay!\"', 'And we got to, you know, \" Who gets to call the patient and tell her the great news?\"', \"And of course, when we're dealing with difficult news, it also helps to have the support of colleagues.\", 'So, big fan of multidisciplinary care.', \"And I'm sure there'll be a number of questions and things to discuss in the Q& A. Thank you.\"]\n",
            "['Bien, voy a hablar de la importancia de la atención multidisciplinaria.', 'Como ya han oído, me llamo Ann Partridge.', 'Soy oncóloga médica en el Dana-Farber, donde me centro en el cáncer de mama en mujeres jóvenes en particular.', 'Y no puedo resaltar lo suficiente la importancia de la atención multidisciplinaria para todas las pacientes con cáncer de mama, pero en especial para las pacientes jóvenes.', 'Les daré un ejemplo del por qué, desde mi propia práctica, y me extenderé un poco sobre la historia y lo que implica.', 'Sabemos desde hace décadas que la atención multidisciplinaria marca una diferencia.', 'A finales de los 80, el gobierno del Reino Unido encargó un informe, el informe Forrest, que proponía nuevos principios de cribado del cáncer de mama.', 'Entre estos principios se encuentran que las pacientes con alto índice clínico de sospecha de diagnóstico de cáncer debían someterse a la triple evaluación, que incluye una exploración clínica, la revisión radiológica de las imágenes, y una vez realizada la biopsia, el análisis histopatológico de muestras de tejido.', 'Y concluyeron que la evaluación de las anomalías detectadas en el cribado requería técnicas especializadas.', 'Y estas técnicas las realiza mejor un equipo multidisciplinario experto.', 'Este equipo debe estar formado por un médico, un radiólogo y un patólogo, todos entrenados en el diagnóstico de la enfermedad mamaria, con el apoyo de un radiólogo, una enfermera y un recepcionista.', 'La disponibilidad de estos equipos es un requisito previo esencial de un servicio de cribado del cáncer de mama.', 'Así que ese fue algo así como el comienzo del reconocimiento formal de la importancia de los diferentes papeles que, diferentes individuos, con diferentes conocimientos, podrían desempeñar para una persona con un diagnóstico de cáncer de mama.', 'Y, posteriormente, a lo largo de las décadas, muchos países han adoptado un enfoque multidisciplinario en cuanto a la atención, en diversas formas y modos.', 'En EE. UU., donde ejerzo, muchos hospitales comenzaron a hacer lo que se llamó comités de tumores.', 'Y es aquí donde grupos de expertos se reúnen y revisan casos de pacientes, asignan diagnósticos, y luego deciden juntos programas de atención que ofrecer al paciente.', 'Por supuesto, el enfoque varía de un centro a otro, pero muchos incluyen a menudo la participación de un médico a nivel asistencial, un cirujano, un patólogo, un radiólogo y un oncólogo, con participación variable de especialistas, enfermeros, profesionales relacionados con la salud, y vamos a entrar en algunos ejemplos que son especialmente pertinentes para las mujeres jóvenes.', 'A veces los representantes de los pacientes están en estos comités de tumores formales.', 'Y, luego, en raras ocasiones, los propios pacientes son invitados a los comités de tumores.', 'Aunque esto es menos frecuente, y especialmente cuando surgen problemas de privacidad, no quieres a un paciente en la sala cuando estamos hablando de otros pacientes.', 'Eso puede volverse bastante complicado, tanto desde el punto de vista de la confidencialidad, como también desde el punto de vista logístico, para muchas de estas cosas.', '¿Cómo suelen funcionar y, funcionan?', 'Bueno, hay datos que se han ido obteniendo con los años que sugieren que realmente funcionan.', 'Este es uno de los primeros estudios que se realizó en Michigan, Estados Unidos.', 'Y la pregunta que hicieron fue: «Clínicas multidisciplinarias de cáncer de mama.', '¿Funcionan?»', 'Esto se llevó a cabo en el Henry Ford Hospital en Detroit, y ellos mismos desarrollaron, como hacían muchos en ese momento, en los 90, una clínica multidisciplinaria de cáncer de mama, la MDBCC, para ofrecer una «ventanilla única», consultas y apoyo para pacientes recién diagnosticadas de cáncer de mama.', 'Y aplicaron un enfoque de control histórico.', 'Así que compararon a las primeras 177 pacientes, atendidas en su nueva clínica multidisciplinaria, con 162 controles que habían sido atendidas el año anterior de la manera secuencial tradicional, donde la paciente iría a ver al cirujano, y luego tal vez después de la cirugía, a menos que el cirujano pensara que podía necesitar terapia preoperatoria, la enviaría al oncólogo médico, y al radiooncólogo, a medida que el tratamiento fuera evolucionado.', 'Y puede o no haber personal de enfermería involucrado.', 'Podría haber otros profesionales involucrados.', 'E hicieron una revisión retrospectiva de historias clínicas para evaluar la puntualidad del tratamiento.', 'Ya saben, ¿con qué rapidez consiguió la gente la atención y los tratamientos?', 'Así como para evaluar la satisfacción de las pacientes.', 'Y sabemos que la puntualidad del tratamiento en muchos contextos sí importa, y también es un indicador de la calidad de la atención.', 'Y lo que encontraron fue que su clínica multidisciplinaria de cáncer de mama aumentó la satisfacción de las pacientes al alentar la participación de sus familiares y amigos, y ayudar a las pacientes a tomar decisiones terapéuticas, lo cual es muy importante, tomar una decisión terapéutica que esté en consonancia con las preferencias y valores de las pacientes.', 'Pero también, y esto es muy importante, redujo el tiempo entre el diagnóstico y el inicio del tratamiento.', 'Se puede ver una disminución promedio bastante sustancial de unos 12 días, y muy significativa en términos de análisis estadístico.', 'Este fue uno de los primeros datos en mostrar que sí importa, en términos de resultados fundamentales, la satisfacción de la paciente, así como el tiempo hasta el inicio del tratamiento, que puede repercutir en el efecto del tratamiento y en los resultados de la enfermedad de la paciente, como hemos demostrado.', 'Y así, en la actualidad, son muchos los posibles miembros del equipo multidisciplinario, sobre todo cuando pensamos en mujeres jóvenes.', 'Y sólo voy a hablarles un poco de este esquema.', 'Por supuesto, las diferentes clínicas estructuran las cosas de diferentes maneras.', 'A veces, la persona es atendida por varias personas el mismo día, en la misma clínica.', 'A veces, se atiende a la mujer en el transcurso de unos días o de forma secuencial cuando es adecuado.', 'Y de nuevo, repasaremos un ejemplo de una paciente dentro de un momento.', 'Pero hoy en día, dependiendo de los problemas de la mujer, y sus necesidades, y su enfermedad, se podría empezar con el cirujano de mama, porque a menudo es la persona que envió la biopsia en un principio, pero entonces también se podría necesitar al cirujano plástico muy pronto, si el cirujano dice, bueno, usted podría necesitar más que solo una mastectomía parcial, o usted podría necesitar cirugía oncoplástica.', 'El oncólogo médico, por supuesto, quiere opinar, el radiooncólogo, si se va a considerar la radioterapia y la paciente es candidata.', 'El radiólogo participa pronto, para obtener imágenes de la mama, especialmente en los tumores detectados mediante cribado.', 'Los patólogos analizan el tejido.', 'La histología es la guía.', 'Para las mujeres más jóvenes que no han terminado de formar una familia, un especialista en fertilidad.', 'Sabemos que queremos que esa persona empiece pronto a hablar con el especialista en fertilidad, para asegurarnos de que no quema un puente y que no pierde la oportunidad de preservar la fertilidad si va a recibir tratamientos que disminuyan la fertilidad o con los que tendrá que esperar.', 'Y para casi todas las mujeres jóvenes, suele haber un tratamiento que las hace esperar al menos hasta cierto punto.', 'Asesoramiento genético, importante para muchas pacientes con cáncer de mama en la actualidad, pero especialmente para las pacientes más jóvenes donde la probabilidad de tener una predisposición genética es mayor.', 'Incorporamos a los asesores genéticos pronto, muchos, a la vez que se las diagnostica, y ese día ven al cirujano, al oncólogo médico, y al asesor genético, porque eso puede afectar a sus decisiones terapéuticas con respecto a la terapia local.', 'Y, cada vez más, en este caso para las mujeres con enfermedad metastásica, podría afectar a sus opciones de tratamiento a nivel sistémico.', 'Y veremos si los estudios en curso sugieren que también debería afectar a sus opciones de tratamiento adyuvante.', 'Un equipo de investigación también participa a menudo, en la atención multidisciplinaria, en particular, cuando existen opciones en investigación de las que la paciente podría beneficiarse.', 'La fisioterapia, si están debilitadas por el tratamiento o el cáncer en sí.', 'Y luego tenemos los apoyos psicosociales, como el psicooncólogo o el trabajador social, entre otros.', 'La nutrición, la enfermería, por supuesto, juega un papel fundamental en el cuidado de nuestras pacientes y otros grupos auxiliares, así como los grupos de apoyo a los pacientes, a menudo pueden intervenir.', 'No he visto en mi práctica profesional un grupo de apoyo al paciente directamente en la clínica, pero tenemos muchos apoyos cara a cara y grupales que incorporamos con rapidez cuando podemos, especialmente para nuestras pacientes jóvenes.', 'Y en la era COVID, hacemos de manera virtual, por supuesto, muchas cosas que hacíamos virtualmente de todas formas solo para comodidad de la paciente.', 'Así que normalmente estos son los miembros.', 'Estoy segura de que me olvido de alguno.', 'Y durante el debate, me encantaría que me dijeran de quién me estoy olvidando, así puedo completar aún más este gráfico.', 'Pero prometí un ejemplo de paciente, esta es una paciente real que vi la semana pasada, e incluso he cambiado las iniciales.', 'DD es una mujer de 40 años que presentó una masa en la mama izquierda.', 'Notó por primera vez la masa en la mama en junio de 2020.', 'Y durante las semanas siguientes, notó que la masa había aumentado de tamaño, de tal manera que, para agosto, fue remitida para un estudio diagnóstico.', 'Por lo demás, está sana, afirma no tener problemas de mama, imágenes diagnósticas o biopsias previas, y no presentó erupción, prurito, dolor ni galactorrea, solo una masa en crecimiento en la mama izquierda.', 'A finales de agosto se le realizó una mamografía diagnóstica en un centro médico externo, un centro médico académico, que reveló una lesión de dos centímetros según el informe en la mama superior en el lugar del problema palpable.', 'Y se asoció con algunas calcificaciones polimorfas que eran irregulares.', 'Y luego también se observaron nódulos satélite más pequeños adyacentes a la lesión dominante.', 'Y una ecografía mostró una masa dominante de 2 centímetros con márgenes espiculados, altamente sospechosa de malignidad.', 'Se sometió a una biopsia ese día, o unos días más tarde, que mostró un carcinoma canalicular invasivo, o cáncer de grado 3 o de grado alto, y se asoció a DCIS no invasivo, y el tumor era negativo para receptores hormonales, negativo para el RE y negativo para el RP, y HER2/neu 3+ o positivo mediante IHQ.', 'Así que, de verdad tenía cáncer de mama, lo que no sorprende dada la historia, aunque fue ciertamente sorprendente para ella y su familia.', 'Vio a un cirujano en ese hospital académico externo como primera parada, derivada por radiología.', 'Y este recomendó que fuera directamente a cirugía para una mastectomía parcial y evaluación de los ganglios centinela.', 'Y, afortunadamente, vino y nos consultó la semana siguiente.', 'Y eso fue estupendo, porque cambiamos el plan.', 'Así que vio al cirujano con el que trabajo, y a una enfermera especialista quirúrgica que trabaja con nosotros.', 'Como parte de nuestra práctica multidisciplinaria, toda paciente que ingresa como paciente recién diagnosticada que aún no se ha sometido cirugía, o que tiene problemas allí, es vista por un cirujano y un oncólogo médico, idealmente el mismo día.', 'Y normalmente así es como funciona.', 'Y a veces un radiooncólogo el mismo día.', 'Así que vio primero a la cirujana y a su equipo.', 'Y luego me vio a mí con un compañero, junto con un asesor genético que nos siguió.', 'Y todos hablamos en la trastienda antes y después de revisar sus registros y ver a la paciente, mientras la paciente está ahí, especialmente cuando las cosas no son sencillas.', 'Pero incluso cuando son sencillas, seguimos haciendo un traspaso de la cirujana a mí o viceversa.', 'Otra cosa buena de nuestra práctica multidisciplinaria es que llevamos muchos años haciéndolo.', 'Por tanto, la cirujana a menudo sabe lo que voy a recomendar, e incluso los estudios en los que podría pensar, y viceversa.', 'Normalmente sé lo que ella va a recomendar.', 'Obviamente siempre lo comprobamos, y hablamos con la paciente, y le decimos, creo que ella querrá hacer esto, pero espera hasta que te vea, porque, ya sabes, podría equivocarme, porque dejamos que ese especialista aplique su experiencia.', 'Así que revisamos su imagen externa junto con radiología, antes de ver a la paciente, y la patología fue revisada por nuestro patólogo.', 'Fíjense en la multidisciplinariedad, esas personas no están en la sala.', 'Ahora son muy virtuales, pero ya habían visto sus imágenes y su patología.', 'Así que pudimos contar con esa visión extra.', 'Y en las imágenes, nosotros, en realidad nuestro radiólogo, vio otra lesión en la misma mama que no había sido comentada por el hospital externo, y se recomendó una resonancia magnética para determinar si estas dos áreas eran contiguas, lo que haría menos probable que pudiera preservar la mama por adelantado.', 'Y, entonces, en el examen mediante las imágenes, aunque toda la documentación decía que el tumor medía 2 centímetros, en el examen medía 4 centímetros, ocupando una gran parte de su mama, y la posterior resonancia magnética, que obtuvo después de irse, alrededor de un día más tarde, de hecho sugería que había afectación ganglionar en la axila, y las áreas parecían ser contiguas en la mama.', 'Se hizo una FNA en el ganglio, y en realidad aún no conozco los resultados.', 'Pero estábamos contentos de que hubiera acudido a nosotros.', 'Vimos esa mancha adicional, hicimos una resonancia, tiene un cáncer de mama mucho mayor que los dos centímetros que le indicaron.', 'Y la idea de llevarla directamente al quirófano con un cáncer de mama de ese tamaño, potencialmente positivo para ganglios, positivo para HER2 y negativo para los receptores hormonales no es realmente la forma en que actuaríamos nosotros, ciertamente no es multidisciplinaria, pero tampoco es necesariamente la forma ideal en que actuaríamos ahora porque después de ver a la paciente y comentarlo en la trastienda, recomendamos un abordaje preoperatorio.', 'Quería preservar la mama, si era posible, y se optó por el abordaje preoperatorio o terapia sistémica neoadyuvante porque, está recomendada, porque su tumor es grande, y HER-2 positivo y RE/RP negativo.', 'Sabemos que va a recibir terapia sistémica.', 'Va a recibir quimioterapia con terapia anti-HER2, porque ese es el enfoque estándar.', 'Y quisiéramos administrarlo como tratamiento neoadyuvante para reducir el tumor y posiblemente permitirle conservar el seno.', 'Otras ventajas son que, en la actualidad, en el contexto del cáncer de mama HER2+, así como con el cáncer de mama triple negativo ahora, la respuesta que una persona podría tener a la terapia preoperatoria puede de hecho orientar las terapias posteriores.', 'No voy a entrar en detalles, pero ciertamente, se está convirtiendo en un nuevo estándar de atención en pacientes con cáncer de mama HER2+ según los datos recientes y que están surgiendo.', 'Entonces, al administrarle un tratamiento podría quedar claro que necesita un segundo tratamiento, o podría quedar claro que no necesita el segundo tratamiento después de su terapia preoperatoria.', 'Por último, otros beneficios de la terapia neoadyuvante en esta situación concreta es que le podría dar tiempo para hacerse las pruebas genéticas, ver la cirugía plástica, si terminara necesitando una mastectomía, para considerar opciones óptimas de reconstrucción, si fuera necesario.', 'Y, al final, saben, terminamos ofreciéndole un ensayo clínico.', 'Por lo tanto, nuestro estándar actual para la terapia anti-HER2 preoperatoria es utilizar THP, como lo es para muchos, especialmente en el mundo desarrollado, donde estos fármacos están disponibles.', 'Son Taxol, Herceptin y pertuzumab.', 'Y tenemos un estudio que está probando Taxol, margetuximab y pertuzumab.', 'Por eso la apoyamos para que participe en ese ensayo.', 'Y pareció una buena opción, así que ella está planeando participar.', 'Por todas esas razones, tanto el enfoque multidisciplinario, como el plan de administrar terapia neoadyuvante en esta paciente concreta era lo correcto desde el punto de vista oncológico.', 'Y creo que sin el enfoque multidisciplinario, y especialmente en un lugar en el que siempre lo hacemos, por lo que sabemos que eso es lo que hay que hacer desde el punto de vista oncológico, estábamos felices por esta mujer, que vino para una segunda opinión, y que de hecho transfirió a nosotros su atención, aunque vive bastante lejos.', 'También la derivamos a trabajo social, porque tiene hijos, y queríamos consultar con ellos acerca de cómo hablar mejor con sus hijos y apoyar a su pareja.', 'La derivamos a nuestros colegas de enfermería, porque va a recibir quimioterapia, eso la haría perder el pelo, el taxano.', 'Y así, la vamos a preparar para la técnica de enfriamiento del cuero cabelludo.', 'Y también fue inscrita en nuestro programa auxiliar especializado para mujeres jóvenes.', 'Así, es un enfoque multidisciplinario real, que creemos que mejora cómo se sienten las mujeres a lo largo de su tratamiento, la confianza que tienen en su atención médica y sus decisiones, así como, a la larga, posiblemente sus resultados, en especial cuando afecta a las decisiones terapéuticas y la eficacia del tratamiento, en última instancia.', 'Esta paciente tampoco quería tener más hijos, de lo contrario habría considerado la derivación a endocrinología reproductiva.', 'Y, por último, la atención multidisciplinaria y la toma de decisiones permiten que esto suceda de manera oportuna.', 'De este modo, cuando se tiene una clínica multidisciplinaria, se puede hacer todo esto junto muy rápidamente y todo el mundo está listo.', 'Eso no quiere decir que sea fácil, o que no haya obstáculos que saltar, y problemas logísticos tanto para las pacientes como para los profesionales sanitarios, pero cuando uno está acostumbrado a hacerlo, y, ya sabemos, hay algunas dificultades de encaje al principio, seguro, veremos que podemos hacerlo realidad.', 'Y esa paciente acaba de venir y acudió a verme la semana pasada, obtuvo imágenes diagnósticas adicionales, y se sometió la aspiración con aguja fina en los últimos días, y la vamos a preparar para el estudio en la próxima semana.', 'Así que, va a comenzar pronto.', 'Muy bien.', '¿Y qué nos dijo la paciente y por qué cambia su atención médica para venirse con nosotros?', 'Bueno, sintió que la tranquilizaba que su equipo de oncología médica y de oncología quirúrgica recomendaran el mismo enfoque y que estuvieran de acuerdo en que tendría que ver a un radiooncólogo si conservaba la mama, o dependiendo de su respuesta a la terapia y la afectación ganglionar.', 'También apreciaba la comodidad y el enfoque oportuno de la atención médica, ya que quería recibir tratamiento y el tratamiento comenzó lo antes posible.', 'Y no se sentía cómoda con la idea de entrar incluso directamente en quirófano cuando visitó al cirujano inicialmente.', 'Así que, es una situación beneficiosa parar todos, para la atención multidisciplinaria y para la paciente, en última instancia.', 'Así pues, concluiré aquí.', 'Y como mencioné, hay varios ejemplos de por qué es importante la atención multidisciplinaria.', 'Yo también diría, como profesional sanitario, que atender pacientes con cáncer de mama es un desafío para las pacientes, a veces puede afectar emocionalmente, y tener colegas con los que se comparte una paciente y se les brinda apoyo juntos, hace que sea mucho más, supongo, motivador, y no tan difícil tanto para la paciente como para los profesionales, porque todos compartimos el cuidado de la paciente.', 'Compartimos los buenos tiempos.', 'Compartimos los malos tiempos.', 'Otra paciente recientemente tuvo una RPC, respuesta patológica completa al tratamiento preoperatorio en nuestra consulta.', 'Y nos enteramos por patología, y los correos electrónicos eran: \"¡Sí!\"', 'Y llegamos a, «venga, ¿quién llama a la paciente y le cuenta las buenas noticias?»', 'Y, por supuesto, cuando lidiamos con noticias difíciles, también ayuda tener el apoyo de los colegas.', 'Así que soy una gran fan de la atención multidisciplinaria.', 'Y estoy segura de que tendrán un montón de preguntas y cosas que comentar en el turno de preguntas.. Muchas gracias.']\n",
